what all right let me give you the quick recap of what you're going to learn in this course and then I'll switch to the
next slide so so what you're going to learn in this course you're going to learn about the
basics of generative AI fundamentals where what is it what is generative AI how it is different from traditional AI
and you will be going to learn the modern architectures yeah like uh transformers LLM which is large language
model yeah and you're going to have the hands-on experience with IBM Watson AI
okay so whatever topics you are learning theoretically will be exercised will be practically exercised over the platform
what's X okay so with that you're going to learn how to choose how to fine-tune
foundation models how to perform prompt engineering how to classify extract and
analysis data how to use pre-built labs to practice the real world use cases
yeah so these are uh these uh these uh will be exercised in plat uh what's an
AI platform okay and you going to learn the prompt engineering techniques how to craft effective prompt uh how to apply
the techniques to reduce bias how to improve accuracy uh grounded uh AI
generated outputs so these techniques you will be learned under the prompt engineering techniques okay and you're
going to work with foundation models so in that we do have concepts like
understanding tokenization embedding and in a working LLM yeah how to choose the
right model for the scenario given real world task and you will be learn how to
approach any problem uh how to scalable a foundation model okay and you will be
going to learn about uh how to use rag pipelines how to generate rag pipeline
which means how to combine LLM with external source using
rag and the same thing will be exercised which is practiced over the platform
Watson AI and you're going to learn how to build and deploy AI powered chatbots uh
which will be practiced in Watson AI as as well in how to integrate uh the chatbot with
natural language responses so uh as I said before we're
going to practice all the concepts in IBM tool which is called as Watson AI okay so in that we will be learning uh
real world industry use cases like legal automative customer services
so these are the topics that you're going to learn in this course hope it is clear
okay now after completing the course what are the skills will be enhanced now
let's look on that so once you complete this course you will be having these are
the skills that you that has been exercised over the course so you are
able to build a solution geni
solution so which means using Watson you can able to build and test generative models okay
and you will be good in prompt engineering so which means uh you you know how to apply effective pro prompt
strategies and techniques okay and you know how to
apply foundation models which means you you you will be having a very good understanding on how to choose and how
to work with foundation models in IBM okay and uh you have a good skill on
implementing rack which means building a hybrid system that combines LLM with real data and you can create chat bots
uh using IBM Watson you can able to build and integrate the conversational
agents so these are the skills will be exercised these are the skills will be
sharpened once you complete this course after this course so is it clear
okay so now you have a clarity on what you going to learn and what will be the
uh what are the skills will be exercised after this course what are the skills that you got after this course now let's
understand the uh progress the road map of this course
okay so you will be this is a sample certificate so after completing this
course you will be get a certificate from us IBM Certificate so how to get
the certificates so over the course you will be getting a IBM C login right and
you assigned to the course uh geni using what's next okay so there for every
module you will be having a set of quiz you have to complete the quiz and this certificate will be generated so if you
ask me this only this certificate alone is um enough to um get marks for this
course no okay so we do have one more as I said mentioned earlier we have a LMS
which is called a prollearn okay in the prol we will be having different evaluation periodically over this 20
days okay so every uh for example it can be a quiz it can be a assignment okay so
everything considered um every task is considered for the marks okay so cumulatively the IBM
Certificate plus the marks which you are getting from this prolong assessment uh
will be given as a final marks that you got from this course am I connecting
okay so you will be getting all the credentials on uh on or
Monday your IBM CP access and your prologue access i think you all must
might receive your IBM C access your prologus will be given on Monday uh all
the session recordings materials which shared in the classroom everything will be posted over there you can watch it up
recordings uh session materials uh and any task which is assigned those also
will be marked over there you have to complete the task and you have to upload the uh your work in LMS only in prol
only
yes sometimes assignments will be conducted in the live class as
well okay so if you don't receive the uh IBM CP credentials no worry you will get
it soon
once the ass when I uh announce the assessment or sorry assignment we will I will let you know about the deadline as
well okay so I guess no uh if things are clear to
you and someone asked me like uh if you missed the session slot one can I attend
slot two if no the answer is no you cannot if you are assigned for slot one
you have to fix with sorry you have to stick with this class only and uh I will
be sharing you the WhatsApp link if you have any queries you can post in that group WhatsApp group it's
just a second give me
So in chat I have shared a link it's a WhatsApp
link so just click on the link and you um to join the group if you have any
doubts um you can post it over Yeah
okay hold on a minute i just check on about uh the WhatsApp link and I let you know okay
all right shall we start the
session so before we uh Okay I just missed out one more
thing and this is our today's objective in today's session we're going to understand about what is generative AI
history of generative AI yeah we're going to understand the difference like what is AI ML deep learning and we're
going to understand neural network okay and we're going to understand about deep
learning architecture and we're going to have a hands-on like which is going to uh
generate random text using the mac over chain so these are the things that we're going to cover in today's
session so
Okay so before we before I start up the session I have a scenario okay uh just
visualize the scenario and drop your answer are you all listening can I narrate the scenario
yes great okay the scenario is now you uh you open your phone and see a photo
of yourself as a cartoon character okay your friend says uh I need an AI tool to
generate that for your selfie in 5 seconds okay another friend replies like
yesterday I asked an AI to write a poem about my pet or maybe a dog or cat and
it actually made me cry now the question this is a scenario okay uh and the question is what do you
think is happening behind the
scene so what is happening behind the scheme
yeah let me repeat the scenario [Music] um okay the scenario is you're opening
your phone and seeing a photo of yourself as a cartoon character okay uh one of your friends says that I used an
AI tool to generate that from your selfie in 5 seconds okay another friend
replies uh yesterday I asked an AI to write a poem about my pet okay and the
poem was like actually made me to cry so this is a uh just a small scenario okay
uh from this scenario I have a question what are you thinking is happening behind the scene
okay yeah some text generation image generation
good okay first one is image generation and second one is text generation
good okay ai is working funny
okay okay now since many has given the answer
of AI I now let me ask how do you think AI is able to do creative
tasks how do you think AI is capable to do such creative task
drop your answers
please drop your answers i'm looking [Music]
neural networking training by human
okay feed more data in order to train it okay i got so many answers
very good thank you so much for all the responses um so how does AI creates
human like and creative outputs just trying to um mimic like a
human just trying to um create replicate human emotions so those comes under deep
learning model and this process is called as generative AI so what is generative AI it's a AI model which
ables to generate new contact content like text image code etc now I have a
question what uh how geni is differ from traditional AI so we have traditional AI
right how it is differ from Gen
AI heavy training data
okay my question is how gen AI is different from traditional AI generating new content okay
okay okay good many of you given the right answer let me give my answer okay
so gen uh traditional AI can do predictions and uh classifications based
on the data which we have fed already
right so traditional AI help us to help us on decision making based on the
patterns in data whereas gen AI which help us to create new content it can be
the new content can be a text image or a music okay so by learning the patterns
from the train data it will create a new data so traditional AI help us to
predict and gener help us to create the new content okay and what kind of output
this traditional AI can give it will give any um like uh uh it will choose
data from the predefined rules okay whereas in Gen AI it will not see u the
content during the training it will create based on the data which is trained
already can can you all give a example for traditional AI one example for traditional
AI uh very good stock prediction alpha okay okay search engine accommodation
very good very
good so we can say uh spam email detection um
uh image classification voice search phase detection so those comes under
traditional AI when it comes to generative AI we do have charge GBT where it will write article it will
generate image it will uh give uh code yeah and we do have DL e which help us
to generate images from text yeah and we do have some AI which compose music and
generating code so this is a difference between traditional AI and uh generative AI okay so how we have to feed the data
when it comes to traditional AI it will learn patterns and apply them to the
labeled and categorizing data okay whereas in generative AI it
will learn structure of the data and from the structure it started to
generate a new similar data so this is how traditional AI and gen uh geni datas
are dependent okay when comes to the techniques core techniques yeah in
traditional AI we will be using either supervised learning unsupervised learning yeah where we'll be having the
concepts like decision tree SPM random forest logistic regression yeah whereas
in gen AI we are using the core techniques like transformers diffusion
models yeah generative uh adversal network which is GANs so
these are the core techniques which involved in geni hope you all got the
difference between gen AI and traditional AI is it clear shall I move on to the
next am I going fast am I speaking fast is my pace is okay with you all
yes we do have uh someone is keep on asking about the attenance criteria from the beginning yes if you're concerned
very much about the attenance yes we do have the attenance criteria to pass the C exam
[Music]
uh I will be giving only the slides the PPT what I'm showing in the
classroom will be uploaded in the
LMS okay
moan sai um how will you record the attance you're you're registering to the
Zoho right every single time you're joining through the Zoho
right okay shall we move on to the next
topic
yes so here I have few real world examples for the um text generation so
if you want to generate a text we can use either chargy
claude uh can anyone tell me some other AI which can be used for generating
text very good slider good co-pilot yes good meta good perfect so if you want to
generate an image we do have tools like uh
Dolly Mid Journey if you know any other AI which can generate image you can put
it on the
chat okay so if you want to generate a music uh these are the tools which you can
generate music and if you want to do code we can uh we can use GitHub
copilot okay
all right I got so many answers thank you thank you for the response now we'll move on to the next
topic so here we're going to understand about the evaluation of generative
AI okay before before going to this I do have a question to you all
so if you want to generate um
um a new uh context it can be a text image or um song which one you will
choose and tell me why
My question is clear
let me ask the question again uh if an AI could do anything instantly do one
creative task for you like writing a poem or painting a picture or it can be
designing a dress or writing your homework what would you ask it to do first and tell me why
okay plot for code okay charge
GPT okay
okay good uh interesting responses thank you now let's understand
the Great now let's understand the um evaluation of Gen AI so in early
early days early foundation 1950s to 1980s we do have the concept called
rulebased system okay so AI focused on rulebased logic and symbolic reasoning
okay uh which is very limited mainly this is used for uh uh uh generating
games okay or some basic automated response okay uh for example if you take
in 1966 something uh there is uh there is a called Eliza okay it's a rulebased
chatbot which will mimic some uh psychotherapist using pattern
matching okay so in early foundation 52s 80s we have AI uh which is purely
rulebased step okay that AI focused on rulebased okay and which is very
limited and in statistical model era which is from 1990s to 2000 we do have
prob probabilistic model which means we are slowly they are slowly shifted to
probabilic approach which means um we do have something called hidden makeover
model HMM okay and engram language model these two are the approach which was
used on '90s 1990s to 2000 okay these two are help us to generate text
generation basic text generation and mostly it is used for autocompleting or
simple sentence building this
AI okay so in early days we do have rule based approach this rule-based approach
is very limited and it is help us to focused on uh rules and uh like uh
rule-based logic and symbolic reasoning okay in 1990s to 20 uh
20ou 2000 we do have the probabilistic model it it is uh following the approach
of hidden markover model okay uh which means basic text generation like
autocompleting uh or creating a simple
sentence okay from uh 2010s okay where
the rise of deep learning architecture like CNN RNN don't worry we'll learn
these terms in detail in the upcoming slides Okay so these help us to create a
coherent sequences of text image music
okay so this in 2015 we do have something called deep dream uh which
help us to by Google this was by Google okay it help us to producing dream like
images uh from 2014 we have the GANs okay which
means generative adversal network okay uh this help us to create some realistic
images videos even faces as well so where deep fake videos are started to
evolve like some realistic human face okay and from 2017 uh onwards we
have the transformer era okay so uh that was the time of introduction of
transformer okay and we have the LLM which is large language model okay with
help of these two they started to build a model like uh GPT yeah so there was a
revolution on natural language understanding and generation so there we
uh during that time we have the charge GPT version two which is released on
2019 and charg version 3 which is released on 202020 now which version are we are
using of
Yes chat GPT4
good great
okay so from 2021 onwards we have the generative AI which is multimodal
generative AI has been evolved from 2021 onwards this model can pro process and
generate text image audio and video so that is why we do have the open AI um
uh we have the models like open AI open AI uh doll E uh GPT for fourth version
from the fourth version only you're able to generate image uh and uh audio video
everything so we have
Germany so let me give you the timeline in short so from 1950s to 1980s we have
rulebased
generation if you want you can make a note of it
yes all the slides will be provided after this session everything will be uploaded on
LMS okay someone asked me what is rulebased generation okay um uh you can
say this rulebased generation um this is a old way of meth like in early days in
school if you want to write an essay uh your teacher will be giving set of rules
yeah predefined rules so if it is a essay always it should have minimum three paragraph yeah you should use um
if you're writing a positive essay you should use only the
um happy words yeah and okay let's take for example for a poem if it is a poem
uh every line must have only five words and all the rhyme uh the last word
should have the rhyme yeah second and fourth like all the alternative line should have the rhyme yeah uh so we we
have some uh restriction right similarly in rulebased AI they follow a strict
handcode logics uh it is predictable but it's very limited
is it
clear yes okay so from 1990s to 2000 we have
the statistical language model uh for that I have given example of um what was
example I have given make makeover chain right or similar like that which means
uh they will be giving a set of
ouch okay so they will be giving a set of word from that a basic text
generation will be happen for example if I try to uh type
um good and automatically it will show some suggestion like night afternoon or
evening yeah so such kind of uh automatic generation has been uh
generated text has been created from 1990s to 2000 yeah from 2010 we had the
deep learning and RNN okay from 2014 onwards we have the GANs for images and
video in 2017 onwards we have the transformers LLM like GPT yeah so from
2021 we have the multimodel generative AI which can able to create new
things so what could be the future
okay someone is asking what is multimodel multimodel means where you can uh get multiple types of data which
is called as multimodel
alita I didn't get what is your question can you please uh explain it you want me
to explain each algorithm right away or how
do now we are using multimodel generative
AI from 2021 plus we are using multimodel generative AI
Bye-bye shatakumar I'm so sorry i'm not ignoring your question my inbox is dumbing with many uh responses so I
could I I can see from the uh last only i'm so sorry i'm not purposely ignoring
any of your messages
all
right so we'll move on to the next Sure I will be explaining
uh about RNN and CNN when we uh when we start to learn about deep
learning in upcoming slides i will explain those okay now I have some uh
some interesting information so there was a person who is called as Alan Turning uh this he is called as the
father of computer science okay in 1915 he published a paper
Um he published a paper uh in AI okay in that the paper name is computing
machinery and intelligence it is published in 1950s okay in that paper turning asked a question a set of
question okay can machine think okay um he offer a uh offer test now famously
known as a turning test okay in
1956 a person called John McKur who coined the term artificial engineering
sorry artificial intelligence it's just for an
information now let's understand what is AI ML and deep learning are they are
different or same is AI ML deep learning are they are different
or they are same what will AI do in future
[Music] um maybe I think in future it will be
became more personalized
what do you think
that pages of same book okay
okay I can understand it's your uh in your perspective it is it won't be
personalized why why don't you think like that why it can't be
personalized so all are almost same okay
now let's understand um these three terms in detail okay now
tell me what is
AI in simple mean one word in simple term tell me what is
AI don't say artificial intelligence okay
agree with your points
Chase it is a agent good good
answer get human good navin computer brain
okay gt
okay all right so I got so many
answers we can say uh AI is a machine which thinks like a human
uh maybe we can put in this term human intelligent exhibited by a machine
right um so from when AI gets started can I get the
answer from which era we have AI
very good 1950s so from 19 started around 1950s we
have this AI ai is a mimic human uh cognitive function such as learning
reasoning problem solving and perception for example a chatbot that can answer
like a human example
Alexa so we do have chatbots autonomous car robotics so all these comes under
AI now what is ML
ml is a subset of AI where machine learn
from data to make the prediction
decision without any special programs which is called as ML so from when ML
starts evolved let me see the
answers very good
Disha okay now the right answer yes
um I got so many answers and the right answer is 1980s around 1980s this ML has
became more prominent okay so with help of ML you can able to filter your emails
um you can learn the message which can be blocked or unblocked yeah in uh if you are watching
uh if we take any OTTs okay let's take Netflix where it can recommend movies
based on your past watching habits [Music]
yes so in this ML only we do have the supervised learning unsupervised
learning and reinforcement learning these three techniques are used to train the
machine for the predictions i hope you all very clear
with what is supervised unsupervised and
reinforcement so those who don't know please drop in chat maybe I can explain you once
okay let me explain um as I said before machine will learn from a given data we
just going to train a machine to understand the data in that we have three types uh data can be in two ways
one is structured data another one is unstructured data so uh if it is a
Indian mobile phone number how many digits it will be if it is a Indian mobile phone number how many digits it
will be any city in India it will be in 10
digits right so if I want to make a Excel sheet where if sorry if I want to
make a database where I'm going to store this data I can set the data limit as 10
where all the digits will be stored this type of data is called a structured
data okay so if you are dealing with the structured data then we have to use the
algorithms of supervised learning okay and we do have another
type of data which is called as unstructured data for example if I take
if is all your Instagram feeds are same or different tell me is all your
Instagram feeds are same or
different is all your Instagram feeds are same or different
is all your Instagram feed same or different i didn't get any answer maybe network issue just a
minute i just charge my laptop
it will be different right so if I want to create a database for each of your u
fit data will not be same right uh some will get 10 likes some will get thousand
likes some will get few comments some will get more comments yeah so this is called as unstructured data if If you're
dealing with unstructured data then we have to use unsupervised learning okay so in when you're going to train a
machine you have to use any one of the machine learning algorithm okay the algorithms are classified into three
types of learning which is supervised learning and supervised learning and reinforcement learning let's take an
example of uh weather prediction okay with help of
fa past weather data can I predict tomorrow's data with help of past data
can I predict tomorrow's weather data i'm sorry can I predict tomorrow's
[Music]
weather yes right so I know the input input is last past
data weather data right so which are called as labeled data okay so when you
are dealing with when you're going to train a machine with some labeled data
yeah from that you're going to predict the future to get the correct answer which is called as supervised learning
in supervised learning we do have the algorithms like regression classification
[Music] um decision tree so we have many algorithms
okay and the next one is unsupervised learning okay this model is trained
based on unlabelled data uh we you don't have the answers you will give the
possibilities from the possibilities it will categorize the inputs and from the
categorization it will predict the pattern and from the uh after the production it will give the answer for
example you're taking a survey in a mall uh the customer's preference so based on
you don't know what the customer like exactly so you will ask 10 set of questions to understand his likes and
dislikes from that you're going to decide okay this set of audience likes this product so you can sell to them
which is called as unsupervised learning for unsupervised learning we will be using
um uh algorithms like what are algorithms that we have uh k nearest
algorithm uh then hierarchical algorithms many algorithms are there
those algorithms are help uh used to train the model and third one is
reinforcement model okay this model is it will learn by trial and error method
we don't have the exact input or output okay whether it's a labelled or unlabelled you're just going to um uh
try from the uh datas okay uh for example let's
take an example um you're creating a robot okay and to that robot you're
teaching how to play the games or how to walk
so the robot will teach from the actions right so these are the three different
algorithm which we which we used in machine learning hope it is clear to you all
[Music]
i miss my uh sorry uh is my screen is not visible huh
okay I'm so sorry just a minute let me share my screen again
hope it is visible now
okay all right so hope you all clear with the uh supervised unsupervised and
reinforcement model
okay let me explain the unsupervised learning
again see when uh if you are going to train a model okay with unlabelled data
which means unstructured data you couldn't predict the input or output for example let's take your you have a robot
okay to that robot you are teaching um how to identify the fruits okay so if
you know the vegetable name you can easily tell okay this is carrot this is pumpkin those have some label so if you
have the labels label data you can easily predict the output which is
called as supervised learning okay in supervised learning we will train the model with label data we know the data
with answer okay when it comes to unsupervised learning we don't know the
data uh we don't have the uh label data we will be having unlabelled data which
means no answer is given for example a person is coming
uh with few symptoms and he doesn't know what disase is that the doctor has to
predict what disase that the patient is having so he will be asking a set of question uh to understand um
the dis okay so from the uh patient's answer he will find a pattern and
confers okay you might be suffering from COVID yeah this is called as
unsupervised
learning sham is it clear
no you cannot categorize ji into any one of these three types these are machine learning algorithms
so the real time uh applications of machine learning are in emails you are getting your spam spam mail filters
right and we do have the uh fraud detection have you all seen if you are trying to pay in transaction with your
debit or credit card you if if it is a uh fraud transaction it will give you a
alert of um stopping your transaction so fraud reductions can be done even in
banks they do have uh the loan approvals so based upon your transaction sibil
score they will check whether you're eligible to take this loan or not yeah that is uh machine learning it's because
of the machine learning algorithm and product recommendation so in your Amazon
if you are buying a product yeah based upon the product history it will suggest
a product for you so all these are example of machine
learning now let's understand the deep [Music]
learning [Music]
so deep learning is a subset of machine learning okay uh ML techniques that
mimics human brain function that is deep learning okay so in in human brain we do
have different we have many small small neurons right so the subset of ML that
use deep neural network we do have multiple layers these layer process
large complex data like image audio video so that is called as deep learning
so from when deep learning
evolved it's from
2010 very
good so if we see the examples of deep learning which is face recognition in
phones yeah so after 2010 we got the face uh in mobile phones we do have the
option of face unlock right voice assistance
So these are the real time examples
of deep
learning okay you're not able to see the full
leage one minute let me share the screen again
give me a minute so till then do you have any doubt like do you got the clarity of what
is machine learning what is AI what is ML so all the or are are same or not are
they all same or they are different
so
so now let's visualize this they are not as yeah there there is there is a difference
so so it's like an umbrella so in AI this ML DL and foundation we have missed
foundation model so what is foundation model that is generative AI the one which we are using
right so this this is an advanced AI model which built using the transformers
a type of neural network okay which is help us to generate
content this model like this foundation model trained on large diverse data set
so it can perform multiple task so from when foundation model uh like this gen
AI evolved it's from 2020s so if you have taken the example of this
generative AI we can say chat GPT IBM what's an X
AI so if you give a code if you give a text prompt this Watson AI will give
code for it okay so this is a general visualization of
Okay just come so this is a visualized relationship between the uh AI ML DL and
FM which is gen AI so these three uh these are the subsets of AI which all comes under AI
these are not same so here here we have the comparison
table so AI which is a simulation of human intelligent and what is ML it will
learn from the data to make predictions and DL it is for deep neural network for
learning so AI use rule based or logic uh learning approach ml use statistical
model and DL use neuronet network with multiple
layer here we have how machine learning
works okay so here we have the common misconceptions so
uh most of us think that AI MLDDL are equals actually they are not equal they
are different how they are
different so AI is a broad concept it's about machine mimicking human
intelligence right ml is a subset of AI so ML uh learned machine patterns from
data and from that it started to the prediction okay so DL is a subset of ML
ml subset is DL okay this uh DL used neural network which has many layers to
learn complex pattern so they are not equal
okay so all all these ML A uh MLDDL geni
all are involving AI learning methods is that
true for example rulebased systems or AI but not ML is it
true not all AI learns
so this rule based system like experts the system or decision tree or hardcode
logic are part of AI but they are don't learn from data so they don't follow if then logic
ml follow if then
logic uh if you want an example see uh we do have the AI chess game yeah chess
AI in chess they have fixed rules no learning from the past but still it is
an AI and here we have the DL is always
better than ML is it true is DL is always better than ML
no so deep learning is when you have a very lot of data computational power
complex pattern yes during that time we will be using deep learning but it is
resourceheavy it need more GPU it need more memory it needs huge label data set
yeah so in many real world use cases if you take uh fraud deduction or if you
take score calculating Yeah
so ML is often better for smaller and tabular
data it is not DL is always better ml is also often better depend upon the data
set and it is not true all AI learns on uh it is not true because rule-based AI
does not involve in
learning only ML DL foundation model only these three are involved in
learning uh AI is not not all AI is involved in
learning and AI MLDDL they are not same ML is a supererset whereas sorry AI is a
supererset whereas ML and DL are the subsets
um hope till then things are clear to you
So can we uh can we do some practical because so far we are learning only
theoretical can we do something in practical
um pretty I'm sure I can see all your chats so long you're asking the same
question okay so are you all good in Python shall I give you some task in
Python are you all good in that
how many of you are not good in Python please put me put on chat
this
okay only basics okay uh let me explain you the task okay
first not good in Python okay just give a try
okay no problem maybe at end of the session I can share you all the links once again
okay this task is all in in Python only shall I give the task then shall we do the task
then yes so remember um after AI what is
evaluated I have we have just discussed about the um evaluation of AI right so
in 1950s to 1980s we do have the rulebased generation
right so from '90s to 2000 we have the statistical model era yeah so over there
they have used mark over model now we're just going to try that model okay we're
going to create a basic text generation
okay okay let me let me open a whiteboard there i will explain
you i'm so sorry i I just not prepared any PPTs for the task
yes you can use any of your ID if you're good in notebook you can use notebook if
you are good in um VS Code you can use VS Code
stop
shoot so this is our task
we're going to generate a random text using the concept marco chain okay now
let me explain you what is marco chain okay
so this is a stat statistical model which was used in early uh 20s okay so
this will help us to predict the next word
for example [Music]
um if I if you're training the text
okay If this is a training text okay the cat sat on the
mat so how this algorithm will work okay it will breaks the word into pairs okay
this pairs is called as engram
okay so if it is cat if it is cat then next if it is the
word the then next word could be either cat or matt okay so if it is the word is
cat what will be the next word
what should be the next word if it is cat what should be the next
word very good it should be sad right
so if it is sad what should the next generative word
it is not understandable okay let me explain you once again okay see this is
mac over chain is for text generation okay uh it will analyze the body of the
text which you have given okay so from the text what it will do it will split
the text into multiple small small words okay with the words it's try to uh
choose the next word on the pro uh pro probability for example if it is cat the
next word if you're writing a sentence we use grammar uh projective adjective everything right so it for for example
first time you will teach them okay if it is cat then it will be the next word should be sat
so like that we have to train so we have to give
on so if it is
on then next word will be
the last if it
is Matt And that's the end the generation
should end here so this is the core logic now what
we have to do we have to create the Python libraries maybe I
can write it down here
we have to create the possible libraries in Python
so how to create the library in li if it is a
sorry dictionary right so where we have to give
the so if it is a dictionary what is the rule in dictionary we have to give
the key and its value right
are you able to
follow this so already I just created the
library in Python i'm just copying that and putting it over here
[Music]
so did you understand the core concept
now shall we write the uh Python code for this concept
so can you all try
Proed Adita from next time I try to create a PPT event for the uh task
please don't rely on JPD for creating the code try by your
own just the in-class session
okay let me repeat the
instruction i'm so sorry i don't have any idea about it sure let me explain the code how to
write it up
let me open my notebook
just a second i'm just opening
notebook going to share my screen please be
eight you don't need to submit this just for your understanding just for in-class session you don't need to submit this
code um okay jupyter notebook has been loaded
okay first what I'm going to do I'm going to um import the function random
because uh I want to generate the word randomly from my dictionary okay so I'm
going to import the Python inbuilt module called random so import
random next what I have to do can anyone guess it up now I have to give the text the text
which I'm going to train okay so uh this is my output text it's just a simple
text okay so I'm creating a variable called text in that variable I'm just
going to uh store the value so this is my variable inside this variable I'm
storing the sentence life is
simple but we
complicated okay so this is my input uh uh sentence and I'm going
to make build the marco chain okay just on the simple sentence okay first what I
have to do I have to split the text into small small words right so for that I'm
going to use a inbuilt method i'm just going to create a variable called world in this word variable I'm going to break
the sentence into individual words by splitting small small spaces so which
one I have to split which variable I have to split i have to split this variable called text
because in that text only I have stored all the sentences right so here I'm just
giving the variable text dot split oh
my Python what my Python will do my Python will divide all these thing into
small small uh chunks right now I'm going to create a empty dictionary to
store this marco chain uh each key will be a word and each value will be the
list of word can follow
it first let's build the
dictionary chain equals okay so in this I'm going to I
don't know how to call it up right so what I'm going to do I'm going to use the
looping for loop okay through the loop i'm going to call each word except the
last one why we are calling the last one we are not calling the last one because the last one looking for the it's not
looking for the next word remember first word will looks for the next word next word will look for
the uh another word but the last word it don't have any uh next word that's the
last right so I have to look for the last before word
over here I'm going to write a for condition for I in
range from where I have to going to check from the word right first I have to calculate the length because I'm not
going to look for the last word okay I'm
sorry i could do like
this okay so for I in range of length worth minus one see from the uh variable
word I want to find the last before word from the last before I have to repeat
that many time I don't want the last time that is why I'm calculating
length inside
that I created new variable word so from the word this one in array in
array value if it is zero the new word will be stored in the word and next
successive uh variable will value will be stored in the next word so continuously it will be move on like
that so word stores the current word and next word source comes immediately after
that in the text okay and over here I just used chain dot set default word and
with that I just already there there is already there is no key in the dictionary so I'm creating a empty list
and and then I'm just adding that to the new word next word that ne next
immediate word so this will build the dictionary of word
transition now I have to pick a word randomly from it right so what I have to
do
then so from randomly I'm just going to pick from the words and I'm just storing
that in the
Third I can give this code all in
once i can explain it to you
so this will randomly pick the code pick the word okay and we have
given for in range of 10 we are generating up to 10 or more than 10
words to create a new sentence okay and to get the list from possibly the next
word for the current word we have used next word equal to current word we are
just doing the swapping and if there is no next word we are just
stop generating it up now let's see the
output very
complicated the code is clear if it is not clear uh maybe I can share this code with you all in
chat this is simple one easiest
one i have shared this code in chat
so any doubts any query on this Good
i have shared the code okay let me share it once again
i have shared this code
sure okay first let's decode this code maybe I just over it i just add it over
here okay so what is our input quickly let me uh give it to
you so this is our input right so over here we are just splitting the word so
word in words in text I have given this word so in words I'm just uh splitting
the words into small small text okay so what I will be getting i will be getting
something like this right now here we are just going to use
the marco chain uh algorithm right so how do we build the marco chain we will
be we have to create the dictionary so the dictionary will be something like
this so life is if it is if is we will be giving simple if it is simple we will
be giving the next word is but for but the next word is we for V the next word is complicated for complicated next word
is it okay so this is a we are just dictionarying the word so it is the last word no next word so it is not in the
chain okay so now word is equal to since we have used random choice word word
will will pick any word for example let me take but okay if the word has picked
the random word but now how it will
work it will uh if word equal to but so after but what is the next word v after
v what is the next word complicated after complicated what is the next word it so it is the last word it ends here
there is no other word right so we got the
result but we complicated it so that is that is the result that we got is it
clear exams will be in the MCQ type okay maybe I can share you
this also for
understanding okay with this we are winding up today's session
i will share this uh PPT i will share this task everything in um LMS okay once
the LMS is ready there I will put everything
okay in today's class we have just discussed about uh what is gen AI what
is the difference between geni is different from traditional AI and we have seen the difference between
AI ML um deep learning and found foundation model and in ML we have
discussed three types of learning in detail and we have just seen a small task in py Python right so if you have
any doubts you can drop your doubts in chat if not Thank you so much for joining the session we'll meet on
tomorrow's evening 5:00 thank you all if you have any feedbacks or if you have
any expectation about the session please drop in chat
uh Shivam uh for this course like if you want to if you consider about this geni
with Watson X we are not going to use Pythonm okay because in that tool uh it
will automatically generate the code for you this IBM Watson
tool the recordings will be there in LMS you can access it at any time and you
will be receiving the LMS credential on one day yes thank you
all q yes you can leave those who don't have any doubts
you can leave the session thank you all
see if you if you are joining the first slot then you have to join all the all
the session in first slot only if you are joining the second slot then uh if
you're in second slot then you have to join all the slots in second you cannot alternately switch
from one slot to next
slot kakash what is your
query access will be given on
Monday you will be receiving all the uh uh portal credentials on Monday
tomorrow you have to join the session same link sure I will explain the marco chain
concept once again tomorrow right then thank you all I
don't think so you have any queries
So I will explain this concept on second by tomorrow
