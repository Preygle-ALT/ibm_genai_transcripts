hello everyone good evening am I audible to you
all yes thank you for the response okay did you all practice
um instruction based
prompting yes I have disabled the uh quiz in prollearn i want to ensure that
everyone has uh have got their credential LMS like
um so if everyone is able to access your prol then I will active the
Okay see in last class like when I asked you for the um prollearn so you have not given the
proper input in the uh form i was I was forgot to give the email id so without
your email id I was not able to fix your prollearn issues and that's my mistake
i'm sorry today we have quiz of course we have
quiz so let's start the quiz by 6:00 uh meanwhile those who are having
issue with your prolearn or any portal issues please fill the form meanwhile I
fix and we can start the quiz so the link is there in
chat i will drop in WhatsApp as well so please click on the link and drop if you
have any issue with any portal issue it can be IBM C it can be prollearn or it
can be IBM cloud any portal issues please fill the
form see if you are mailing your concerns uh that you're facing issue
yeah I understand but while mailing or while uh WhatsApp please drop your
um your email id kindly hereafter don't WhatsApp me kindly do
emails drop only
emails no problem once I enable your quiz it is active for four to five
class you can comfort uh comfortably complete the quiz within the time
limit 1 minute
Okay i'm sorry it's official call i need to take it
up see quiz bill not visible right now
um so please do fill the form if you have any doubts so shall we start our today's session so last class we have
seen how to use um uh third party uh foundation model to create a
instruction based prompting so in today's class we going to create how to create a gen code based
prompting so did you all practice the last class uh code
yes you have quiz today um and the quiz will be evaluated for 10
marks
okay I think you all very concerned about the quiz i told you the quiz I will make
sure once everyone uh once I make sure that everyone is not having a issue with your prollearn then I will uh enable the
quiz
Ar quiz is not postponed it will be happen today i will enable it
okay I'm enabling the quiz those who want to do the quiz right now please complete it so I think after completing
the course you all let me to take up the class so I enable the quiz right
away so
You people are very concerned about the quiz uh test
assignments okay the quiz is live now you can all start doing the quiz take only 10 minutes now time is maybe I can
share the screen uh time is 5:10 so within 520 please do complete the
quiz so it is
visible you have maximum three attempts if you want to score more uh like if you want if you would like to take it re
again you can do it it has three
attempts krishna Gupta now that quiz is live you just go and check how many questions are there
so those who are having issue with any of your uh portal access please drop the text kindly don't WhatsApp me see I told
you not to WhatsApp me during the session time i have given the uh link in chat
please complete fill the
form see I genuinely want to fix the issue that is why I have taken the WhatsApp call so far but no uh you
people are taking it for granted I guess like uh I'm just getting a u textes even the late night on
Sundays just not fair
so if you have any issue please email
me if you want to do it later then it's your choice it will be alive for 5 hours
[Music]
see you can uh I have uploaded the quiz it will be active till um by end of the

complete up the
quiz the quiz will be alive till 12:00
p.m so you can attempt at any time and you have maximum three attempts
so if you have any issue with the quiz or any issue sorry if you have any issue
with your uh prollearn uh your any credentials like prollearn IBM C IBM
cloud please fill the form which I have shared in the which I have shared in the uh WhatsApp
uh chat and group
Okay so you have five more minutes to complete the quiz those who are uh doing right now
Just a minute
all
right you all done those who are doing now did you all
done
anyhow the quiz will be there till uh 12 a.m
right maybe you can try a little later okay if the site is not working
not a problem you can try a little later okay
ibm C same as skill network since on skill network we can see
RT since we have not received any
mail okay see IBM C is the course see you are
learning the course through the portal IBM C okay ibm C there you can see the
modules what are the the detailed course structure will be there see uh in this
course in this um jai with Watsonx you do have seven modules I guess so all the
seven modules has been detailedly elaborated in the IBM C portal okay now
how to access this IBM okay IBM C so this can be accessed via two ways okay
one is either from the Android prollearn.in If you received any email
credentials from us mentioning that the or Android [Music]
um skill network.in you can login with the credentials which you have got mail
ID and password if you didn't receive any mails then remember last class I
have shared you one link skill VIT skill network link you all registered under this domain vit skill v.skll network so
over there you will be having register button so you have to click on the register button and then please drop all
the um informations which asked over there and then login up so while registering please make sure the name
okay what name has to be print on the certificate you have to give the correct name okay and you have to use uh the
email id which you have used for the course enrollment
your IBM C exam will be conducted on that site only
yes focus you can give maximum three
attempts yeah I will be sharing the VIT skill network once again in the chat
so I have shared this G network link in
chat stop sharing the screen
so here I have shared the screen uh see this is for those who are not get their
IBM skill network if you have uh raised the query in chat that the IBM C access
so over here you have to those who not received any login credentials from us
okay regarding your IBM Credentials I'm talking about if you not received any
credentials mail from us then use the link which I mentioned in the chat by
clicking on the uh link it will redirect to you this page
over okay so over here you have to click on
register and then you have to drop all your informations see this IBM C is very
very important because here only you will be having your final main exam and
the certification is very important it's globally recognized
certificate so here you have to give your full name how do you want to be printed in the certificate in the same
way you have to give the full name registered email id the email id which you have used for the enrollment and the
uh profile name password then click on create an account for free so once it is done then you have to sign in and there
you can see your IBM C course I mean your uh genai with what's next course
will be ritur that's what I told you if you
received a credentials credential mail from us then there we have a separate link use that link just put the user ID
password login up if you didn't receive any such mails then use this method and
registered
yourself chanu if you received the mail then use the mail mail credentials
you will not get any mail from C you will be getting mail from Android technologies regarding the uh C
credentials those who have any issue please fill the
form see every class we are just utilizing this 30 minutes for getting this uh fixing this uh credentials
issues
okay the form link i'm again sharing the form link please do complete the
link which is there in chat
okay so if you have any issue please fill the form now let's start with the
today's class i'm just going to open IBM cloud why it is not working it's the
Oh my god I forgot my password
please log on to your What is this
i think IBM server is quite down that is why I'm not able to log in IBM cloud
itself uh so do any other uh logged into IBM cloud
okay thank you yes um as I said I think um server I
server is down
so let's revise the last class so
Okay uh since the tool is not working let's use Google Collab or if you are comfortable with any other um ID you can
open that okay
ma'am last she thought how to give input and out oh you're we are revising yes thank
you so I'm stop sharing so let's open Google
Collab so over here let's do a task
to do this task you can use
um Google Collab or you can
Python note Jupyter notebook as
well so over here let's build okay my screen is shared
okay now uh let's do a task the task is like we just going to build a uh text
prompt okay so we're just going to create text to image generator so if you
give a uh the web based application so where you're going to enter a text prompt and it will generate a image okay
so once you all open the uh IDE please drop the confirmation in chat so we will
start the project
so what we going to do we're just going to create an application if you give a context a small sentence simple sentence
this application is going to generate a represent image for that okay so to do
this we're going to use the tools um hugging face diffuser library so last
class when we trying uh transformer that is also hugging face library one of the
hugging face library okay and we're going to use pyouch transformers
yes so first let's install the required uh libraries to our terminal i'm going
to use pip so through pip I'm going to install uh
what are the libraries that we going to use we're going to use diffuser we're going to use
um
transformer so So pip
install transformus
diffusers
spicy so I'm just going to use accelerate save tensor as
well see the
rate save 10
source so these are the libraries which are required to create
so we have to install diffuser
transformers accelerate and save tens so let's run this code
so once you give all the libraries it will take few seconds to install
yes of course if you are very comfortable with VS code then you can use it
up so here we have this
So we have diffusers transformers spicy accelerate tensas
flow so once you have installed all the libraries please update
me tarun Kumar where did you join the session
shall we move on to the next step do everyone completed this step
okay so once we all done now we're going to
use just a minute
uh just a minute just got to
Okay i'm
sorry so all the package has been installed successfully now I'm going to
create okay so already we have imported the library diffuser so from the
diffuser library we going to install few um modules
so here I'm I'm going to use the uh model stable diffuser pipeline okay so
from diffuse
diffuser diffuse oh oh this
error from diffusers I'm going to import the
model stable diffusion pipeline
Okay so after then see this this table diffusion pipeline this is a pre-built
pipeline so this will handle the all the comp all uh it's a kind of object bundle
component okay so it it this is responsible for generating images from
text so how it is working working based on the stable diffusion model okay and along with that I'm going
to use the touch uh which is a pyarch library uh so it's a deep learning
framework this has help us to handle the tensas and computation
okay so I'm just going to use
import touch
r okay so did you complete these two lines
any
doubts let me come to the chat box just a
minute okay so an now we are just going to
create uh since our IBM cloud our interface is not working so instead of
teaching something theory I just want to show a practical task uh how to create text to image generation so if you give
a text as a prompting then you will be getting image as a result and output so how to do that so we are doing it with
the core Python and with some pre uh train
models spicy we have already used it right so how for uh generating remember
in first class when you're using transformers so there we have used spicy
Okay stable diffusion pipeline
sure see this is a pre-built pipeline okay so here you will be having objects
that are bundled together so you will be having different objects which are bundled together okay this this uh this
is helpful or this is we can say this is very needed for generating images from
text using uh stable diffusion
is it clear
torch is a pyarch like it's py you know pyarch library right so in in uh python
we do have different libraries num pi panda similarly you have a library called pyarch so this pyarch library is
uh very useful we are using pyarch in deep learning framework okay so why what is the purpose of this pyarch this
pyarch Without pyarch you cannot handle tensors and computations so that is the
reason here we are using pie chart
is it
clear should I move to the next line of code
okay now I'm going to create a variable in that variable I'm just going to load
some pre-trained stable diffusion model from the hugging face library
okay so let's create a variable called
pipe
oops and I'm going to use a pre-trained model
from stable diffusion pipeline so then how do we have to call it first we have
to mention the model name stable
diffusion model dot
Fusion
pipeline a pre-trained
model so remember when we are using um WhatsApp next there directly we just
go to the uh tool we we have we are using a tool what's next so there all
the uh model has been available so from the drop-down you're just choose selecting the model and you're putting
it up right but here when you're writing the code through python so you have to
type the uh model name over here so here I have just given the model
name run aiml stable diffusion version
Right so we are loading so it loads from the stable diffusion version one model
uh so where this model is located it is loc it is from the hugging face library
right from there we are loading this pre-trained model okay and below to that
we are using uh torch d type equal to torch.flat 16 which means we are just
say we are just making uh when when it is generating it has to perform very
faster so for the faster performance and low lower memory usage so it has to use
one work only on our GPU not in the CPU so for that we are using this half precision method
so the code is clear to you
okay now as I told before now I'm going to use C G GPU not CPU so for that I'm
going to create okay till then things are clear
to you all
once I complete the code I will share all at once
okay so I'm going to check whether I have used
Um
this GPU or uh CPU so why we are using GPU it will reduce the memory usage and
it will accelerate our time like so that the performance will be very fast the conversion will be very fast
okay so
here so I'm going to move the pipeline to um GPU which is uh available for the
faster interface so pipe equal to pipe dot cuda so have you heard about this
cuda have you heard about
Okay actually it is help us to uh uh when you're generating any graphics
for game or a video okay during that time so if you want to unlock their raw
power then we will have to use CUDA okay so in ML training in AI IML training or
image diffuser or video editing we will be using this
CUDA okay so that is the reason here we have given
CUDA so what this will do what this CUDA will do now over here in our
context so it will check for the available uh GPU and then else if it is
not available then it will fall back to the CPU so if if GPU is not available
then my code will be run on the CPU which will uh takes time to load which
will make the application to load slower so literally here we are checking whe
the cur is available uh to run the uh code uh to to run the process generation
process if it is not available if cuda is not available then we are going uh we
are going to run the process with CPU now what if condition is get satisfied
so what if uh cuda is available if it is available then the code is going to be generated on the
particular context now I have to give the prompting right so
in if it is what's next there we do have the option of giving prompts so over
here it's a raw code python uh like here literally you are giving all the code so
you have to give the prompting so I'm just going to give the
prompt so what can we give the prompt what prompt can we give
um
So you can give whatever prompt you
like okay this is my prompt so I want a image
with rainy forest and fog okay so after then I'm going to we
uh I have given the prompt now the image has to be generated right so what I'm going to do I'm going to create one more
variable i'm going to name it as image so in this variable I'm going to store
the image
process so what we have just given uh we are just passing the prompt to the model
pipeline yeah so what it will do it will tokenize the text then it will generate
a Latin image representation and after then it decodes into a full color image
and the output will be stored in the image zero okay this is usually the list of u um images and then it will select
the first image from the list okay and at the last I need to save the
image right
so here I'm just going
to save the image then I'm going to run this
code what happened why I'm not related to
Oh by mistake instead of giving code I have given text so
far so now code is getting
Yes I'm so sorry actually I was in the uh collab tool i when I was in that
screen I was not able to see your chats if it is if I could see yours I could understand that I'm typing in text box
instead of the code block so by mistake I have choose the
text what is the error
disha once my code runs successfully then I will share the code
so it takes uh time to little time to load
meanwhile I'm sharing the code in chat so did anyone got the
image no okay let's see
so that was the advantage of using what's next like that we don't need to worry about giving this like loading
everything so where we can use any uh predefined
model pre-trained model from there it will be composed fast here also we are using pre-trained
model okay so let let it run meanwhile let's all take a 10 minutes
break so we'll meet after 6 at 6:15
take a short break short 10 minutes
break code is there in chat
let's take a short 10 minutes break so we'll meet at 6:15
so welcome back to the session uh did anyone got the output for me it's still loading it's taking too much of time
do anyone got the output
yeah for me also it's still loading
architkumar is what's an like uh IBM cloud is working for you for me it is not
working i have shared the code
already okay
yeah no the code is correct i like it is like we are just using only the module we have not give any specific uh new to
generate right we just giving the prompt it is it is very similar like how we did in the uh IBM Watson X here in my code I
have just given I'm just using all the uh
pre-rained model I have not used any code so it is not looping I guess aditya
what is your perception
okay so install float 16 we have to
use float is it working for you
sorry not I
It won't check like automatically it will uh switch it up right should we have to set set
that sham
great karthikaria got the output
yes as you also just I change my runtime to GPU and let me run the
code okay just copy this code
first let's complete all the libraries done okay
so still the IBM cloud is not
working okay meanwhile let's explore your IBM C
over here if you look at my screen so here in your course in module
4 okay I just share the screen how is this
so once you log into your IBM
C so you can see your course uh geni using what's next okay over here if you
scroll down so they have given some lab
code so here they have given the code for doing uh code
extraction sorry code generation and extraction so here everything has been added with a screenshot so follow the
screenshot and try to create the application when you come tomorrow okay so over here they have given how to see
um uh in in any AI if you give the code for example if you visit charge and
you're giving the prompt like give me a python code for printing 10 numbers okay
so it will give the python code okay um over here we are just going to create an
app which will generate the code any programming language code okay
so here all the steps has been attached with screenshot so please do follow the
screenshot and try to create this
exercise it's a self explained all are everything is self explained uh please
try this exercise as well as we do have another
exercise which is extraction please look onto this exercise as
well so try to create these two exercises
both are in the same form which is uh structured
method um so tomorrow you just try these two exercise so tomorrow first 15
minutes let's explore this exercise once and we will be uh then get into the next topic so over here the third one
is yeah fourth one is a classification project that we will do in the class
is it clear what you have to do before coming to the next class
john already the quiz has been uploaded in your prolearn it is it will be active till 12 p.m you can do at any
time rishik see instead of uh learning from the PPT you have every all the
materials over here in PPD I just mentioned only two or three slides very uh crisp uh only you can see the brief
information over here you have the detailed info uh content okay I'm just
going to your module Hey
So here if you look into any content they have given elaborated information see they have given all the informations
elaborated
informations so you can refer from
this in PPD I have just given only the limitized content so here you have the elaborated content from here you can
prepare for your
exam
tonight I say today's 12 p.m
connect yes Aditya you have to complete lab access 3 and four and if you find anything difficult if things is not
clear you can um we can discuss in the first 15 minutes in tomorrow's class
yes you can see whenever you have time you you please go through the previous
uh module concepts um so as of now we have completed we are
in the fourth module so whenever you do have time please go through the
content okay so here we have introduction uh 1 2 3 around five six
concepts is there right so go through all the concepts and take a skill
check so try like this try to complete first three modules before next class
okay she will check on
that IBM C like you didn't receive any uh credential mail from
us Mandra Singh
sequence is already there in your prolog you can do at any
time before end of this
day see you have to complete every module see at least if you want to generate the certificate at least you
should have the 75%age of progress if you scroll down uh scroll up over here if you look into the progress it will be
showing you course progress okay [Music] um see at least you have to complete
minimum you have to complete 80%age of this course to get the certificate
so start uh start exploring this module 1 module 2 till module 3 please try to
complete before uh tomorrow's class okay and try to complete all the skill check
and once you complete all this topic at the last you will be having final assessment and with that we will let you
know when you can how to claim your certificate
it is compulsory of course it is compulsory then only you will be receiving the certificate from
IBM okay let me check the code
okay uh we got the output uh I can able to see the image the image has been
generated
so did you all got the
output IBM C and Prolon Android proloon or not okay see uh to access IBM C you
might get the link from Android prollearn Android prollearn
link so through android prolon link enable to access IBM C few can access
through that few cannot you have to do with uh vit skill network
uh thank you so much for your message like it is like your I have showed you how to resolve the problem how to fix
the notebook issue a long time back i have posted the video in WhatsApp group itself it is done for most of
you if you missed that then you have to refer uh the
WhatsApp group to check the decade
okay sure so did uh did you all get this
output did you all get the output
uh who was that disha so if you're getting this
message so install float 16 you use float
32 okay let me explain this code once again so over here we are just generating we we are going to give a
prompt so with a prompt it going to generate an image so uh text image generating that is our
today's task to do that see um if you are going to do the same with IBM what's
next in IBM what's next remember how the interface will be so over there we have to select the um crop type then we have
to select the model so simply by giving input and expected output and giving the
uh uh we will be getting the insection we will be giving the instruction sorry
we will be setting up the uh app then in in uh instruction we will be checking
the output it was as simple as it is yeah in that environment in what's the next environment so here we are just
doing from the raw method in in py with the help of python
okay so to do To achieve that first we need the libraries required libraries
for that so with help of pip I'm
installing one sec
so I have just installed diffuser transformers accelerate scap and zert
see why I have just give upgrade already i have just given a um the same the same
thing has been given over
here okay
so after then over here from the diffuser library
I I have used the model I just imported only the model stable diffusion pipeline
I have imported this model now I have a question okay see why we are importing
from the library from the library we are particularly using the model why don't we use a complete model instead of
importing from uh the library every single
Okay the code which I have given earlier was the correct code
adita I have just given the same code i I didn't change anything so I just gave only the one line show okay maybe I just
give the code once again in
chat please find the code in
chat no I didn't do any modification it is same as it is i just do only the one
thing which is image show you can check with my previous as well
even over here I will show this code and the this code are
same nothing changed
yes I missed this point thank you for reminding Hickey Sham see the thing
which I have changed is over here I manually changed the runtime setting from CPU to GPU
so over here I just change the runtime from CPU to T4 GPU
what was the comment that you gave at the end
so here I have the code
so uh if you already installed the diffuser transformer then uh then use
upgrade if not straightforwardly you
can sure harass I will let you know
yes so use this code and let me know whether it is working or not
okay uh regarding the task uh once you done uh logging to your C uh IBM C
access you can able to see this course right so over here go to your module
four developing genai solution uh look at the exercise 2 and exercise 3 which
is code generation exercise and extraction exercise so get into the code generation exercise see all the steps
has been mentioned very clearly of the screenshot look into the screenshot and try to replicate the code see this is
very simple see if we have the uh if IBM cloud works fine i will be
showing this today but uh unfortunately it is not working uh there is
some server glitch okay so this is how uh first of all what you have to do once
you successfully getting into the IBM IBM cloud account then you have to click on all uh what's next it will take you
to the next page from there you have to choose project all view all project create a new project after creating a
new project you have to click on add new assets okay after selecting this uh here
it is showing show showing experiment with foundation model and prompt build prompt but for us it will be showing us
uh this was a older one now it is upgraded as chatbot chatbot with
foundation model and build prompt something will uh the the same model which we have used in the last class so
choose that and then change your see here change your code from lambda 27 uh
0B chat because this is um this this model works very well with the code
generation okay after then you have
to give the instruction and input so once you done
then you can start able to generate the code it is straightforward simple try to
replicate try to create this in before coming to tomorrow's
class try this code as well as extraction code
same step every single time we will be changing the model based upon the uh requirement we
will be choosing the model so please do complete these two
task before coming to the next class
things are clear to
you which order you're talking about
Adita yes of course see all the quests that see in IBM C over
here see if you want to take IBM certification exam in this course at
least you need a 75%age progress okay so over here if you look into it as I saw
before right so here you can see your progress how to get this progress so over
here So you have to all the modules all the concepts
see don't just click next next next to complete the progress just read what is
there inside the course okay
and in every skill check I think you have two attempts to make it up i'm not
sure so they have given a yeah so you have two attempts
per question and if it's a true or false you will be having only one
attempt so here you will be having the quiz so
completing this quiz is also matters and try to
u so this quiz is also taken for graded like for the IBM C exam
okay so this is a small mile milestone checkpoints to take your
um capstone exam which is IBM C exam hope it is clear yes IBM cloud is not
working i think there is some
glitch arti you just dropped a query right is the order matters like what are you talking about I didn't
understand yes Aish what is your
query yeah of course it is matters
like you're talking about this code right this um text to image generation
code or E task lab
task okay someone in in in group they're asking like uh how do you complete each
module means completing in class increasing the progress see it is not like that see this is just to track
whether you have go through all the uh topics in the given module okay if you
look into this module see now if I read all the things then I
will be giving next so this is taken as a progress okay when you go through all
the section in the particular module your progress has been improved from 1 percentage to uh a a small difference
will be there in your percentage
progress am I connecting
i just open all the modules just try to go through the content which is there inside yes of course you have to open
all the modules to increase your progress
yes CB exam is different cb exams like that is there you will be getting a
certificate which is global recognized certificate with a QR
code nakshukra which which assessment you're talking
about yes will show great impact in IBM
C yes Adita the code should be in this order in
uh see if your uh any of the credentials any of the portal access is not working
please fill the form i will be giving the form link
uh okay thank you Anishka surely I will upload all the PPTs i thought PPT will be limitized content so that won't
helpful for you um I will share the TPD in that
case so I have have shared uh Google
form link in chat those who are having issues with your portal access please
fill the form see it's really um I want to fix all the issues all your portal access issue so if you fix if you fix
this then we can utilize this two hours completely for learning something learning newly every day okay so from
next class I will not spend more than 10 minutes for the portal issues so please fill the form and get all the you should
get it sorted by it
so I'm sharing the link again in chat those who are having
um okay so if you have any doubts in
today's session you can drop your doubts in chat and if you have any
suggestions if you want it be in the session that
have this mention
Yes by tomorrow you have to complete the code generation and extraction lab
uh uh those who are having any portal access issue please fill the form
okay uh I will be explaining the code once again from the beginning uh maybe
So over here I'm just install the uh diffuser library is called diffuser
transformer accelerate and save tens okay after then we
just okay so this uh this safe uh stable diffusion pipeline model this model is
from the library called diffuser so from this uh diffuser library I'm in I'm
using this module I'm sorry
model okay then I have imported the torch from the library pytorch okay so
this is helpful for the deep uh neural network learning okay so here I have created a variable called pipe okay in
that variable with the module stable diffusion pipeline I'm just going to
take a model pre-trained model foundation model which is runaway ML
stable diffusion version 1 - 5 okay and below
that below that I have taken the to DT type equal to float
16 so this this is help us to load see when you uh uh this particular code
help us to reduce the GPU memory usage because this accelerated interf
interference time right only works well with the GPU that supports float 16 for
few people it is not supports 16 so you can use uh float 32
