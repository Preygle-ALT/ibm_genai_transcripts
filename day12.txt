hello everyone good evening am I
audible yes thank you Naven so the participants strength is too low so let's wait for 5 minutes so that others
can join so they will not miss the session oh good evening man
good evening Sel okay
yes uh yes Navin uh soon we're going to post a um assignment in LMS sorry which
means a prol you will be having a assignment this
weekend so did you all practice that exercise two sorry three and four I'm
sorry two and three fine
nin almost okay yes good goro
goodie so
GPS and if you notice uh IBM uh cloud account is server is very down we
couldn't access IBM cloud today so what I planned is so let's create an application with uh other ID which means
you can use Python notebook or Google
collab whichever suits you fine
Yes server down um what type of assignment google
Krishna it depends see um we'll see how much we can cover till Friday okay so
based upon the topics which we covered till Friday I will be giving you one task which has to do on the weekend and
you have to submit it on the Monday yes you can use VS code
um a small task not a kind of application a simple task kind of a
programming one and you know at end of this uh course you supposed to submit a project with us so soon we will be
discussing about the use case so you have to we will be giving a use case so in that use case you have to work on and
you have to submit a project okay no assignment will not be in MCQ
format yes it is marked assignment reook okay
mad so once you all open your ID can you please update here so that we can start creating the application
so please do update me once you are ready with your interface
okay today we just going to see how see last class you have created the code
generation application using um what's an AI environment right so in
today's session we're just going to create the same using Python code
and then we're going to understand what is classification and how to implement classification in a
code sure in just a
minute yes how you can use Google Collab as well
yes IBM cloud see IBM cloud uh server is down so we cannot use it right away so
let's practice the code today in either Jupyter notebook or Google Collab or if
you're comfortable with any other IDE please use
that Arian I'm talking about IBM clouds usually where we used to get into uh
what's next right uh that interface is not
looking you have to run that in your PC abinavia
uh last class itself I have mentioned you the in screenshot they have used the old model okay uh but you couldn't find
the same model in the latest what's next which you are using so over that you have to use
chatbot using um experiment foundation model experiment you have to select that
one Okay so shall we create it
up okay so let me put a open question to you all
okay so how will you write a simple uh code
generation with rulebased programming language
so where we have to give if else right if condition exactly we have to use if else
in looping so if you know the machine has to print this code for example if
I'm going to create an application which has to print only the uh factorial or
only the palendrome program I will be giving an if condition if user gives this prompt then print this code else uh
just go with a uh default value right we can do such like that so what will
happen if uh so can can we write the code for all the possible programs like
that will it is it possible no right so how to overcome
that how to overcome that
[Music] um we can Okay we can train a model with
suitable okay very good Madin Kumar [Music]
um okay we can use a model good
Nishant I like GPT good we can uh using any buildin applications good one yeah
you know uh train model from next word prediction
okay good try okay yeah good one yeah we have to
use any trained model so we have we are going to use the same we just going to use some LLM and from LLM we're going to
take on any one applica uh pre-trained model from the pre-trained model which is going to generate the uh code okay
remember last before class we have used how to generate a image from the given prompt
text yeah so for that which model we have
used for that which model we have used no we have not used GPT 4.0
zero for the image to sorry text to image generation which model that we
have
used good stable diffusion hugging face li hugging face is a not a model which
is a library so what is the difference
between model and Ready
what is the difference between library and model
good good shab good man good Sam good
one good ya good
criticumar good brah very good right great right great right great right great right great right great right great right great right great right great right
answer
right okay good gosh good aan
Well done so in uh now we going to use same the hugging face library from the
library we're going to select the uh model and there we're going to start creating the um application okay so what
was application that we going to create in today's session we're going to create a code
generator so how how we going to build it we're going to build through uh transformers
okay first let's install the required libraries so I'm going to use pip
install so tip install trans for
m and I'm just going to use accelerate
okay and I'm just going to to clean my um to clean my output place okay i'm
just going to keep the super bubbles for the output uh space i'm just going to use white
so I'm installing the
libraries so do everyone clear with why we are installing these
libraries uh I had just changed again thank you
so do anyone have uh Okay so if I put that in quiet mode
it will keep my output area very cleaner it's kind of a
cleaner m got it okay
so do anyone have doubt in this particular code shall I move on to the next
code okay see we going to create we all know that we're going to create the application code generator right so
um if I want to generate the code we I have to use the library hugging face so
this hugging face library is available through the it's a pre-trained model which is available in uh uh transformers
so with the help of pip so pip is a command which help us to run uh shell
commands okay so through that I'm going to install transformer which is a hugging face library it it it has many
pre-trained modules um so that I'm using this libraries okay and then I have used
accelerate okay this is optional if you want you can use it or you can skip it
uh without this also your code will work fine just to speed up the model because here we if you give a prompt it's going
to generate a code right maybe the time has to be very fast the the the performance has to be speed up so that
is the reason I have included accelerate if you don't want it is optional you can remove that okay and this quite is also
optional uh every single time when I run my output the area has to be clean so that is the reason I have just used
quite it's a cleaner notebook
fine transform spelling is still wrong yeah sorry I didn't see this i was
in France for
months actually I was in the uh Zoho page to see your comments i didn't see
the error thank you thank you
Adita yes thank you mother i have changed it
up uh it's CPU i have not used GPU because it's a simple small
application
it's my humble request during the session please don't do any
DMs Because every time you send some text now it's like a pop-up box was hiding on my screen i
couldn't so now all the libraries has been installed successfully just a minute official call
okay so Aish what what is the error what was error that you're getting aish so
hope everyone uh install your library successfully
and present this quite is just a cleaner notebook which keeps your output area
clean okay now after this we're just going to
import the required modules so from the transformer I'm going to take only the
modu uh required modules here I have a question okay instead of the library
straightforwardly I can use the modules right why I'm installing the library first then I'm importing the
modules what is the reason
what is the reason
okay it's part of a transformer very good man
very good was the right answer
good good
and sound is coming i don't understand adita is there any background noise you're trying to say there is a
background noise from my side
okay I'm sorry just a minute let me see what it is
i'm sorry i think the noise is reduced now
okay so the answer is like the good uh good good practice is like if you install the module okay from the library
instead of instead of installing all the modules we are just using only the required module so that is the reason we
are first installing the library and then from the library very specifically we taking the module okay so if without
the library the module will not work if the module has to work first of all I have to import the
library so as usual I'm just using
import okay
um till this things are clear shall I move on to the next
Okay ta is a Python library uh we can say this is a core
Python um so from pyarch this to is a core library okay this is help us to
work with tensas and which help us to run our model so that is the reason here we are just importing
touch okay and here if you notice here we we are just use auto tokenizer so
what is the reason of using tokenizer this tokenizer will convert the strings to token and back to the strings again
so that is the reason here we are using auto tokenizer and we have used the model
auto model for casual lm so this model uh specialized for um uh like code
generation it's very um meant for uh ideal for code
generation should I move to the next code
yes okay now we have to load a pre-trained code okay so first we have
to uh we have the model from the model we have load the print pre-trained code
see just visualize just compare this code to your uh IBM cloud so in IBM
cloud you will be creating the what's next in the what's next you will be choosing which type of prompting that
you're going to do whether it's a free or structured so we will be selecting the structure after selecting the
structure you will be giving the prompt input and output so before then you will be selecting the model the suitable
pre-trained model for to complete the task here we are going to do the same okay here we just going to create we
have we just going to choose a suitable model for this so for that I'm creating a variable uh I just keep it as a
model name in this model I'm going to uh uh choose the suitable um
uh code model okay pre-trained code model okay here we're going to use a model called Salesforce code gen okay
this model is a open-source model from a Salesforce okay this this is help us to
generate code in multiple language okay so in double quotes I'm just going to
mention sales force
slashcode jin
hyphen 350 hyphen
multiple so what is this 350 this 350 is size of the models in parameter so you
can give up to 350 uh million parameters which is light so it this
will run on your CPU in collab this will not run on GPU this will run in CPU
because of its
lightness okay now what should come next maybe I can run this
code okay okay no errors we'll go to the next set of code so what should be the next logic
actually I didn't understand like you have given in
um can you please put your uh query in
simple are you asking this out of curiosity You're just testing my
skill okay
i didn't talk anything
Rohit it is not uh I didn't take this code from YouTube hope I didn't take
this code book code from any books okay it just come out of experience um I
think I have mentioned you already i have eight plus years of experience four years I worked as a game developer and
four years I worked as a fullstack developer and here as a project manager
in Android technologies it just comes from experience I guess
and sometimes if code went
wrong no that I don't take that credit like I didn't write the code all by my
own I write the logic if it is goes wrong then I will take any AI help to fix it
Okay thank you for the appreciation so can we continue with the code
it is not like that Arian like if you're comfortable the thing is like if you're comfortable with one program language no
uh you can understand any code all the thing is like only the syntax get differ
but you can easily decode the logic that is what happened here if you give any
code I can easily decode the logic in regardless of the structure Even I can write some code with um error i can I
know uh I made so many mistakes in code but I can decode the logic if you're good in logic you can write a good
code okay uh I think we can continue with the
task uh my question is what should come after this see I have imported all the required libraries i have imported all
the models yeah now I have included specific model this is a pre-trained
model okay here we will be having all the data data kind of data set
okay so what should come next yes Adita you have to see uh in
previous class you have set the uh runtime to GPU right so it has to be
revert back to CPU which we can get little later once let's complete all the things um we have to put in prompt okay
good social good right uh we have to take the tokenizer okay we have to take
the tokenize okay create auto tokenizer object okay
good good good try i appreciate first um now you have
mentioned the model right uh for every model has its own tokenizer because here
you're just going to get the input in the form of string and you're going to process the uh string as a um and in
that tokens yeah the the string has to be convert to tokens which can be understand by the machine and then from
the tokens it will be generating the output so what's the next thing you have to download and load the tokenizer to
your model okay so let's see how to download and load the tokenizer to your
model why we are doing so because every model has its own vocabulary right if
you're giving one string that string has to be converted to its associated uh
token ID this token ID will be taken from any vocabulary which is associated
with comes along with the tokenizer of the particular model now what we going to do we going to download and load the
tokenizer which associate with the model so over
here I'm just going to take type tokenizer
equals auto tokenizer
so from where I'm going to access it from a pre-trained model so should I have to
mention the model name again over here what should come over here in the bracket which parameter I have to pass
here
can you tell me which parameter should I have to pass there
just a minute let me connect a charger
uh can I get the answer which parameter has to be passed here variable what is a variable
name uh good Anthony good one aditya goodas
kia yam it is not GPD2 because nowhere we have mentioned GPT here so here we
are just going to use this model i'm sorry okay so here already we mentioned
that this is the model that we're going to use so over here you have to pass this as a
parameter okay
so now what will happen this language model from the model name I mean uh so
the the language uh it it loads okay okay the variable model loads the
language model
towards okay now let's create a function in that function we're just going to generate the prompt so I hope you all
know how to create a function in
Python so I'm going to use the keyword diff
gin rate underscore code
over here uh I'm going to create a new uh later on I will be creating a variable called prompt uh in that
variable user will enter his prompt okay whatever value user enter on the prompt has to be passed as a parameter here so
I'm just giving it here is it
Yeah uh till then things are clear shall I move on to the next line
okay um shall I proceed no doubts
right
very good most of you have given the right answer
okay now I'm going to create one uh variable in that variable I'm just going to uh get the value in a structured way
so that the model can understand uh the code in a readable way okay so let me
create a variable called input text so over here I'm just going
to get it in a string format okay
uh as uh uh output
code two and whatever I'm getting as a prompt
I'm just going to pass it over here and then I'm just giving those in a
new line slash will be giving in a new line okay so here I just added a structure command so that the model it
helps the model to understand the write readable Python code
okay now this token this input has to
be tokenized yes the text has to be convert into a uh convert to a tensor
using the tokenizer so for that let's decode it encode it
so for that I'm just going to create a variable
input okay input is a keyword so I cannot use it so I can use inputs so
inputs equals tokenizer
tokenizer dot so what is a uh how how to change the
tokens to num vectors with encode function so
we are just going to use encode okay and here we have to pass
the values parameters so what are the parameters we have to pass we have to
pass the
input text and the written tens are
Okay so PT means pyarch okay so here I'm just converting text to a tenzar using
the tokenizer later on I'm just writing the pyarch tensor which requires the model inference so that is the reason
here we are just written tensor to equals to pt pt means pyarch sensor
okay now I'm just going to convert the uh output okay i'm just going to convert
the uh vector to text again for that I'm just going to create one more variable
called output so in this variable I'm going to
use model dot
generate so what it has to
generate I think I made mistake it is showing my color
actually here I forgot to add the
model
here I will be passing the model name
okay actually I missed it that is why when I call the model it
is showing some error okay now generate inside this we just going to pass the
parameter the parameters are inputs because here we have the uh encoder so
inputs uh and then I have to mention the u what the generator will uh will do
here this generator will tells to the model how to generate the code which means the token okay so the maximum
length should be 256 and the temperature should be kind of 0 to 7 you can give
any range below the one if you and do sample we just going to do
which means enabling sampling
okay so max
length 256 and I'm just going to use [Music]
temperature equals 0.7 then
do sample = to
True okay so till then uh things are clear to you
right let me come to the
chat yes
now see now the uh machine taken the tokens uh sorry string it converts to a
token now the token has to be uh revert back to the readable Python code right
for that let's create we have to do decoding because here we have done encoding now we just going to decode to
the human readable format so for that I'm just creating a variable called code in that variable how do we access it now
all the toas are stored in the tokenizer right so I'm just going to use
tokenizer tokenizer
dot decode converting back to the human readable
format there is an error we'll check what it is little later
somewhere i missed the
Okay check that later
okay so over here so where do we have the tokens the tokens are stored in the output right
so let's give let's call the
output
with skip
special tokens equal to true so what is the purpose of this skip
special token okay this will remove tokens like EOS end of state uh sentence
padding so those tokens are special right so this will skip all the special tokens when
decoding and I'm just going to return the code back to the
function now I'm going to get the prompt from the
user and I'm going to get the input from the user so I'm just using the input function so inside that the user will be
giving
um enter the
code that you want to
generate okay so now will will we get the output do we get the output now
yes but here we have to create one more variable so that this will call the
entire function to this variable because we have some
uh we have to call the function right this generate code then only the code will work so for that I'm just creating
um a variable called output
code equals so in this I'm going to call the
v function so what is a function which is generate code so
generate code and where I'm going to pass the parameter
this user prompt so what will happen when the
function is called this uh this this is this variable pass to this function variable and this function will be
called and all the code will be executed and it will return the human readable code so that will be stored in the
output code okay now if I want to print the
um statement so I'm just giving
print third
code so we have to print this variable okay let's run the code
first we have to token let's read the
error it is telling that repository is not
fine okay it was not able to uh get into
the library why so I have given the right library name
everything let me do anyone able to check uh fix the
error what was the error
[Music]
actually so here we should not have this
Yeah so it is asking us what code do you want to
generate maybe we can take this to the new line slash
in slash in now let's stop and run
again okay so odd or or even
number
Already I have skipped this masked this with skip special token did anyone got
the output
okay generated spelling the last okay this is not a problem because
this is inside your print whatever you give that will be print that is not a
problem so here I have the code can you see
this it is working fine if I run this code
again everything will be disappear it's just because of this
um here you while installing the library you have given quite so because of the
quite every time when you run your output area will be clean so hope you all got this output do everyone got this
output sure i will be sharing this code in chat okay from the library
i have shared the code in chat
okay previously I just missed when when I create the model name I missed out the
uh I just made an error in the model name i just give only 350 i forgot to give M capital M so that was a mistake I
made and when I change that it it works fine sham you got it
yes yes Sham you're right so do everyone got the
output can you all please update in the chat if you got the output or not
okay okay you want me to give the input once
um print
hello
world so my output is here i have just given print hello world so here is
my code
okay all
done no problem take your time and try and if you find any doubt anything not
clear let me know
anthony can you please update me what is the error of course the class recordings
will be uploaded in your
drive it is not an error still it is generating the code please wait for some
time
hello uh can you please give me a
Actually I don't understand one of your student has like called me right now
please understand during the session please don't call me don't uh text
me okay it is not recognizing the library uh maybe can you please share
the code exact code what
you okay Anthony no worries I will be sharing this code in prol maybe you can
try after some
time see in your model name you have missed M after 350 you should have M
please I have shared the code right and the code is also visible in the screen please check it by yourself and uh
correct it see only debugging will make you a better
coder all right so with this we all take 10 minutes break so come back by
6:20 we'll move forward the session
okay to you all can we take a 10 minutes
break yes A this code will run in Visual Studio Code
also yes please take 10 minutes break and come back
and which means uh you have not used tokenizer please do
check uh good question sound you cannot generate bigger code with this program
this is a simple lightweight it with this you can able to print only simple uh codes so if you want to generate a
little uh heavier codes then you have to we have to use GPT3 and there we have to use some API keys we have to we because
there is a different interface right if you want to connect that interface with yours then you need some API keys and
with that API keys with that you can able to create it
yeah we can do that
yash okay IBM cloud is working thank you Ragul for the update let me check
thank you Rul for the update
so welcome back the session so uh IBM cloud is working fine so let's do
a task in IBM cloud
okay so now we're going to practice the exercise which is given in your IBM C uh
so the exercise is we going to practice classification so what is classification
can anyone tell me what is
classification meanwhile please all of you log on to your IBM cloud and update me once it is done
are you all there can I get any
response good mother good pers
good criticumar I will explain rishik please
wait in this in this exercise I will explain that so that you can understand much better please wait for a few
seconds okay so here we just uh shall we start the task is everybody's ready with
the enroll uh I mean interface
This
Again my humble humble request to you all kindly please don't text me during
the session should I have to um clarify your
queries in WhatsApp or should I have to take the session please
understand thanks in advance okay now let's create the
project um let's take what's next
i'm launching the application sharing the
screen i'm going to create a new
project just give the project name as class
E5 and I'm on create
did anyone face an issue in creating the application
what's wrong with
This anyone facing an issue like me
okay uh let me check one last time
okay
d
please let's try uh by removing some project actually this is not the right
way maybe a glitch we'll check once
okay I think some glitch again
so everyone getting the same message or do anyone able to create the uh application
Uh possibly can you all please give me a minute let me check with the back containing
Someone again they have texted me i'm so sorry strictly I will not respond to any
of your messages or calls during the session thanks for your
understanding okay I think it's a glitch let's stop this
screen someone told me like they have just get into a project a old project
maybe a P1 so there they are trying to add a new asset
i don't Oh yeah it is working I guess
ah okay
okay someone asked me the reason of using sapling and temperature okay let
me explain it okay see when we are creating a model okay
uh this decoding okay this is uh this is a main thing this thing knows how
language model generate responses how to choose between greedy and sampling
decoding yeah so depend upon your um output depend upon your expected output
this will be happening okay so now let's understand decoding parameters decoding par decoding can be happen in two uh
method which are greedy method greedy parameter and sampling decoding parameter okay so what is greedy uh
greedy parameter which is uh this will select the token with the highest probability
at each step okay so if you do like this so what will be the what will be the
advantage you can structured and inst it can be a structured or instructure
content you will be getting the ideal factual data yeah so so in in which
scenario you have to use this greedy decoding approach so when you are creating an applications like code
generation some mathematical problem or some uh technical document or some kind
of uh FAQ or instructions in these scenarios in these scenarios of application you have to create sorry you
have to use the decoding uh parameter as greedy okay so in the code which we are
using recently we have used sapling decoding so how this sapling decoding
works it works on randomness choosing from uh uh like any token distributing
any token so not just the one on top it will choose uh anyone
randomly how it works how it controls
the parameters which are temperature top K and top B so what is the temperature
the randomness control randomness um if you are taking the highest value it will
be more random okay if you're taking the low value it will be very very less random okay and we will be having the
top key so from the sampling it will be take the top s tokens okay and we do
have the top P also this is for the smallest set of tokens so we use top rarely
so when you have to use this sampling decoding so when you're approaching some chatbot role playinging or some kind of
storytelling script writing so on these um scenarios uh you have to use
sapling okay I hope someone I just forgot the name I'm so sorry uh your has
been clarified okay so over
will explain yes you're
right shoubam okay uh I'm going to share a link in
chat it's a feedback link okay so I want each I uh expect each one of you to fill
the feedback form without fail please do click on the uh form and
update your feedback once it is done update me in the chat as well please
take five minutes of your time
so please use the link which is there in
chat thank you Aki oh yeah sure I will reshare the
link those who missed the link please use it
okay what is the purpose of auto model for casual LM u because that is the
model this model help us to generate
code does it always clarify or should still should I have to explain a bit
deeper uh I don't know this is form from Android like they just want to take a feedback like how the classes are going
on are you comfortable with the class so that is the reason they collecting it
up great thank you Roy
see Salesforce they just we are just using the pre-trained data
set that is not a model that is a data set
preset did me delete that because it was two time by mistake I just mentioned it
two time that is why I deleted
Okay a you
kidding thank you so much for the feedback
don't do like this
buddy thank you for feeling the feedback
tanisha it was a good one um instead of me explaining you can you all please okay take your time just go through the
different types of model in ML and understand why the models are used in those scenario
yes sure I can explain uh Ashna but IBM cloud is not working right okay can I
explain you just by showing the screenshot from the IBM C do you all okay with that can I explain lab 4 and
lab five uh just by showing the screenshots from there so maybe you can
try a little le later later
that's so nice thank you
Shira no these kind of feedbacks made my day thank you
you know uh while developing code like we are like I was in a critical projects where we spend day and night to create a
game no even I didn't get the satisfaction when I teach
Um if you want to be a game developer like uh you should be really good in physics uh you should really good in
math and you should know see it depends if you're going to create a 3D games uh
depend upon the requirement um you should know like I was in I worked with
Unity game engine so there we are using max to max to max we use C sharp so if
you know very good in logic you can place
well hush the cloud is working but we couldn't get create
the Oh really nanit is it so you're good in
game design game development i'm sorry uh no Adit i have not worked with
Unreal Engine i worked with Unity engine
great good choice Aish i think we are deviating from the
uh topic
um Johi just drop a email okay
see if you want to be a fullstack developer you should be really really good in HTML CSS JScript see if you are
very strong in JS you can easily fit into any framework so like mean or m
both comes like both is a full full of JScript right um I was I'm a ME developer so uh I
don't I'm not I don't have much knowledge about other stacks
yes Aish I agree with you the class is not over i'm so sorry
like we are into
Okay see if um Mitra like if the code is not working well in the VS code then you
have to check with the libraries because in uh in collab like many uh libraries
works inbuilt but in VS code you have to literally install it by your own uh so
again if possible you can share me the terminals uh messages terminal outputs but then we can understand what are the
libraries that is requiring for running
up yes yes uh
Shoubam okay uh so do you all agree with sharing the IBM C there can I show the
screenshot because it's a simple thing all need is just an explanation I will show the screen and then you can please
uh go through the steps later on when once everything is fixed then we can you can just create the project by your own
and if you feel any uh glitch or anything not working well then we can do that in next class 10
That's Are you all okay with that
okay I'm sharing this screen project class sorry
classification project
okay see over here we just do we are just going to give classification which means we're going to give a set of uh
instruction from that the machine is going to classify which uh which which
uh type is it okay so first just like uh creating the last project you have to
click on new project selecting the project and you have to add the asset so over here they just give experiment with
foundation model build prompts but the one which we are using the one in your trying you couldn't find the same model
so what you have to do you have to check with um the type what is that I forgot
chatbot chatbot with foundation model uh build prompts so select that model that
prompt okay then it will react over here
so from here you have to select see so far you just worked with structured so from now on we going to work with free
form so what is the difference between structure and free form any
idea structured where you will be using templates yeah kind of input output
format but in free form so this is a a way you can enter any kind of natural
language prompt without restriction which is ideal for testing okay so over
here you are going to select free form after selecting free form you have
to select the model flang ul 20B is it a opensource or IBM
model is it a opensource or IBM model
then you all create along with me no goro it is not IBM model it is open
source it is provided by Google very good a shanka yes yes shira good shira good
rakshit good try if I use him yes it is open source and it was provided by Google very good uh and this is very
meant for generating the um applications like um NLP if you are
going to create any task which is relevant to NLP like summarization
questioning answering code generating then this is a best model to do
okay so here you can use like creating email summarization can be done with this uh
free form plus flag ul to
20b okay now below to this they have a scenario okay the scenario
is over here they have uh this is going to uh respond to the people okay
so here they have given the context you're going to act as a business consultant okay and over here you're
just going to it's a project based thingy and there you're just they have some predefined categories okay and
we're going to describe them okay so they have three categories which
are model management customer care and data security so along to that they have just
given the input so you can take all this prompt
from Google okay so and at the last you can ask what is the project
classification okay by reading all this when you click on generate it will give
the answer it is data security if you compare to the previous uh applications which you made then you will be giving
the input and expected output input and expected output and at last it will
generate the uh output for you but over here you have not given any output sorry
any input or output you have just given a summarization the machine itself understand classify and gives you the
final answer
so are you clear with this so if you notice at the end they
have just given token 27 inputs three generated and 2110 out of 409 so the
time taken is 13 1.3 seconds so what it
means it is telling that the token usage when um so the model reached the natural
endpoint in its resource sorry response that is what is it is mentioned as endpoint sequence token encounter and
below to that you will be having token usage there it is from the input they have taken 27 tokens and the output is
three tokens in to in total which is 210 tokens out of 4,96 token
limit so is this classification model is clear to you
all a final assessment will be kind of
MCQ all right so we'll stop here with this uh from tomorrow tomorrow we will
be seeing um the other
projects okay um how to select the foundation model prompts then general
techniques yeah we will do some sentiment analysis okay
so if you have any doubt in today's session please drop your doubt
and if anything is not let me
know no problem i will explain again yes your project also will be
graded and feel free to drop your feedbacks in chat if you want to be add anything to the session
sure I will explain once
again so you have to submit all the projects in Brolan okay see over here this part
you're asking about this token part Disha and
Madan okay see this was the last okay not
this okay so over here I have given a very big draft so which mentioning the
different name different project description okay I have all these things okay and then I have just asked the
question what is the project classification okay so in in the total context totally I have 207 inputs plus
three generated equals to they have given some data so what is the data all about they have given that token usage
so totally input token is 207 and output token is three okay so in total which is
210 tokens this 210 token is taken from out of 400 sorry 4,96 token limit and
the response time the output generation time was 1.3 second so it is telling how
fast the application is responding to you
okay thank you so thank you all thank you so much uh feel free to drop your feedbacks about the
session i love to see your uh feedbacks thank you
uh are you still I have not created anything in prol
Thank you Shubamu
system yes Moansa you have to complete everything in the VIT skill network just
look at all the modules and there you have to um do the skill check in case if
you don't have any doubts you can wind up for the day thank you to a
Thank you Kitik Kumar for the lovely feedback yes A Shankar what is your
doubt thank you Arvin sorry
Arian Ishan all the recorders will be there in your
prologation of Python code I did with credit model the premium
okay what is it doubt it looks like a statement yes those who are done those
who don't have any doubts you can leave the meat thank you
bye thank you all
