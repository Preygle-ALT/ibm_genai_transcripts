hello everyone good evening
good evening Graves so did you all complete the
task i didn't reply back i'm sorry i might miss because of multiple text
um can you please uh if you don't make any please send right Ready
a we didn't uh we didn't talk anything we are just greeting each other that's it I didn't say anything any important
information okay so the crowd strength is too low so let's wait for a couple of
minutes that others can join Meanwhile if you have any doubts please post your doubts in
chat did anyone face any challenge while creating the task i mean the
assignment yes so what you have to do you have to take your code uh screenshot
and your output screenshot convert it to a PDF format and share it with
me where you can see your assignment you can see your assignments in your
prollearn um yes
um I'm so sorry I'm not available after this session maybe you can drop your
concern your query in the group in the group our task was
easy
happy yes it was a similar to the one which we did in the class see today we're going to create the same thing
sentiment analysis but this was we're going to do with the what's next so inside what's next we're going to use
the API key with the help of the API key we're going to import our um what is that
um data set and through that we're going to create the
application so what I have should I have to explain the concept logistic regression or the whole
thing with an example do you want me to uh explain this with an example how to
do a logistic regression anika program is working
please do check once again yes yeah today I'm going to show
you the Anushka how to work with sentiment analysis in WhatsApp X
okay exactly it will be do give you some
precisions sure i will help you out no
worries sp please don't upload your I uh your um exe file as just like that
please take the screenshots of your output and the code paste it in a exc uh
word convert it to PDF and upload then okay that's
great oh which means you are very comfortable
with the uh models sin
accuracy in terms of accuracy um
depends sure s I'm ready i will explain you just remind me at end of the session
okay because today I just want to start with the lab six exercise once we complete then if you have time I will
explain you that okay
no no no no it doesn't mean that you have to be really good in web development we can easily generate see in interface itself we can easily
generate the API with GUI
method i will show you the output
once sorry today I will be explaining you what is red coding decoding how to
use
it you got the right
answer now a in your PDF you should have your code as well as your output both
the things has to be there print documents also
fine okay so shall we start the task so first let me show you the task
just a minute i will be sharing you in a minute
this is a lab six uh sentiment analysis of a legal document this is also same
like the one which you did as a task yesterday okay here we're going to take a data set in this data set we're just
going to upon the um feedbacks we are just
just going to predict it like whether it's a
positive negative or neutral
okay so what you have to do if you want to do this task then you need this kind
of um data set so you should have a phrase with sentiment can you all um go
to Kaggle and take some data set which which should have a phrase and
sentiment once you all done please let me
know yes I have reverted that to technical team
so once you all done with the uh data set please let me know
so once you're all done once you all ready with the data set please update me in chat we'll move on to the next step
so use Kaggle from the Kaggle take a data set the data set should have a sentiment column and a phrase column
the data set which you are going to take it should have some uh phrase and sentiment
arin please check your Twitter uh tweet classification data set whether it has
some phrase and sentiment um I think I am I'm telling
the data set properly please listen and take the same from the Kaggle
how many of you are ready with the data set
no don't use the movie data set you take
some actually I didn't check the data set second give me let me check once please
okay shall we start the
task yes yes um like if you have the data set which has the sentiment values
of 0 1 0 maybe I can show you my data set you please see every single time if
I give everything from my side then your learning will be not up to the level you please put some effort uh go through try
uh some data set actually I didn't take this data set
I just I just created this data set that is the reason I was not able to share it
I will show you what is the expected data set so
uh I was not able to share why maybe I can open it
here excuse me
um I have important announcements to make uh please remind me to ask about it
by 6:30 okay anyone please take a initiative please remind me about the
announcements by 6:30
okay so I have a simple uh data set which has a ID phrase and
sentiment so with this we just going to calculate whether the given is a positive negative or neutral so you all
have to create a data data set similar to this just like
this if you have any data set which has some phrase not face it should be phrase
phrase and sentiment then that's well and good
please take the data set in such a way see look at the form which I have shown you from the similar type of data set
has to be taken you can take any data set from the kag just make sure whether you have the phrase and sentiment in
it ma'am there is a data set link available huh that was not like that was
for task tun so I will be giving you a 3 minutes
of time so within that please take a data
set or if if someone was not able to find the data set then update me on chat
good to go can we uh create the
application okay you're unable to find Vishnu
see if in your data set if you have the sentiment as true false then you have to convert to a numerical
value so so please you can surf from the g Kaggle
from Kaggle you can find some data sets which has zero and one so do anyone got
a data set from Kaggle which has a sentiment values of zeros and ones please tell me the name in chat so that
we can everyone can use it
up yes you can use any data set make sure the data set should have some
sentiment and phrase okay so I'm sharing a tagle
link please use this data set
i didn't go home
all done shall we start
uh
decimals see the sentiment value should be false between -1 0 and 1 so we just
going to map the sentiment to the text if it is minus one we're just going to give it as a negative zero is for
neutral and one is for positive so make sure you are having that data set with this numbers so someone else has shared
one more data set i'm just giving that or if you want I can give you two
fields you can use any bot to generate a data set like this
so if you're not able to find the data set from the Kaggle then you can use any
AI bot so there you are just ask it to um um generate a sentiment analysis uh data
set it will give you you can take that also just only for the learning purpose
right okay so now get into the interface I'm just sharing my IBM cloud in a
minute
So as usual once we got the dashboard just go to what's the
next and create the project
okay once you're ready with the interface please update me in chat we'll start
it's completely fine no
worries okay
so create a project uh I forgot to mention you that
uh so what you have to do create a project add the asset notebook okay so in this notebook we're just going to add
all the code so we're going to use the Python interface so for that we need notebook
so add the asset notebook once you're done here we're just going to add all the
code so just now I have shown my data set in my data set I have phrase that
phrase is like it it has some um sentences right so which are
extracted from a legal or formal document and I do have another column which is called a sentiment in that
column that column has been represented with a numerical value there they have given just minus1
0 and 1 so I'm going to map the values minus1 is for the negative sentiment and
zero for the neutral sentiment and one for the positive sentiment Amen
okay now we going to install the required libraries to perform this sentiment analysis in our next
environment okay shall we
start yes we are going to upload the data set in the IBM Watson i will show
you how to do that okay perfect so now here I'm going to
install my very first
library okay so what this command will do so over here we know that that
exclamatory mark will help us to run any shell command yeah and then inside the
notebook environment okay and we are installing wget it is a library this
library help us to download any files from the web
okay and here we have used tail minus n1
remember when we are doing a project in Python uh in in some other interface
that we have just gave quite sorry quit yeah so the that quit command is help us
to remove the terminal outputs same happen here also so this tail n minus
one this command is helpful for the Linux okay it's a Linux command this Linux command help us to remove all the
um uh previous project output or last run output from our notebook so this
keeps our notebook
clear so now we are installing a library this library help us to download any data set if you have given the
URL please don't proceed with any of the word okay and I suggest you all to don't
copy paste the code just type the code word by word understand each command then you proceed
forward copy paste will not make you a better
coder shall we move on to the next line of comment
that's fine har Prasad run the line what was the
errors
and actually please don't run the code uh still we are not yet done we need to
add few more libraries to run the code okay now I'm going to install my next
library command which is scikit learn okay remember last class we have discussed about this this we have used
it as a skarn okay when you go with the core python so over here we are just
going to use scikit learn this is also one of the very popular machine learning library this library help us to perform
task like classification regression and clustering so where do all this comes under this classification regression and
clustering which type of
learning uh very good it is ML in in ML we do have no it is not unsupervised it
is supervised
very good all of you so I'm going to give my next
code again pip help us to install the command and then I'm just installing my
scikit library this library help us to import all the machine learning models to my code
and again I'm just using tail command which help help me to clean up my output area a kind of output
cleaner okay now I'm going to install my third
library okay so here I have my third library this library is a Watson X sorry
Watson machine learning SDK you all know what is SDK right
i hope you all aware what is SDK
okay very good question um Madan Kumar so we can use quit yes so
quit is like this command helpful for the tool support environment okay if you have any environment which doesn't uh
which which is not supported over here this environment is much supported by the pale n minus one so this will remove
till the last line
got my point ah very good sdk software development kit you it's not only used for Java for
many programming uh for most of the programming language it it has its own
SDK okay so now we are just going to use the uh install the IBM IBM Watson
machine learning SDK okay what this will do this with with the help of this SDK
we can able to interact with the all Watson X services see if you notice in Watson X we do have many services we do
have Watson AI we do have Watson AI um another environment i forgot the name I
think Watson AI studio okay we do have different services in our environment
okay so this SDK help us to interact with all the services which with Watsen
okay and here I just mentioned the version um uh this code runs but this
version maybe after if if any upgrade comes we have to change the version number here
okay literally this command help us our notebook to interact with the Watsen
tool so if you don't have this command then you cannot able to connect your data set you cannot able to deploy your
model this is very required to uh deploy the model so as of now we have imported
three libraries one is vit which is help us to download any files from the internet another one is scikit learn
which is help us to build write machine learning model and the last one is Watson sorry IBM Watson machine learning
uh library this help us to connect our our notebook with Watson ML services
okay so once you done adding all the libraries you have to just check the output it will take few
seconds to
run okay hope you all got the same output
tanisha I didn't get your query how to open this notebook after importing the data set no I'm just going to import
over from this environment i'm not going to do separately importing the data set then opening the um environment no I'm
not going to do that so over here I'm just going to import
it this command will not work in Google Collab because I'm going to interact with the Watson X services sorry Watson
services so please don't uh perform this code with Google Collab or any other
environment getting
error error for the last maybe I can give the code please check with the code once
again see there I have given the or operator you have to be very careful with the operators
this okay I have given the header um header files over here please take it and replace it with
your code nvin and check whether it's working or
not let's talk about the assignment at the end of the session let's not uh distract from this
code so you all done shall we move on to the next
part good aish so you all done
All
done
okay great so everyone got the output right navin did you got the
output maybe some typo you might be done some typo so that is the reason he didn't get the output last time
okay what is the difference between already told you the difference between uh quit and
tail i can understand so I'm like UI was bit
slow okay I understood so once you all done this now we are going to create the
URL so from which URL we going to fetch the uh API key and we're going to
generate the API key as well okay so what we have to
do just a
minute so go to your dashboard so from the dashboard s just search for
Watson Watson
X okay actually this should be the very first step
but okay so you will be getting this environment yeah the as usual project
creation environment over here scroll down at the last you will be having a option called create API
key are you all able to follow
me yeah sure I'm repeating again see now we are working on a different
environment right so what you do open a separate environment there you open WhatsApp uh IBM cloud okay in that IBM
cloud
just one
sec Okay I'm I'm sorry by mistake I have stopped sharing my
screen so this is our main interface right every single time when you try to create a project we you will be getting
this screen okay so from this screen what you have to do you have to uh we we as usually we will be clicking on launch
right so once it is done we will be getting this screen okay over here
scroll down so this should be the uh step like uh this should be our initial
step actually initially I forgot to mention you that so over here you you do have an option called create API key so
from here you have to select this option create API key and you can give any name choice is yours i'm just
giving um
ML learning you can give any name it's absolutely optional
engine once you gave the name just click on create so you will be getting a key
see make sure the key will be available only for a limited time just copy the
key then come back to your
code i'm coding i
forgot actually
I and here you will be getting one URL so you have to copy this URL as well
and paste it in in in a text file unfortunately I have closed the
window it's already done
by mistake I have closed the file okay this is our interface here we are coding it
up so to the last so so far we have only the headers now I'm just going to add
the URL uhoh
okay okay so over here what I'm going to do I'm going to create a variable called
URL in that variable I'm just going to paste what I have copied from the create
file okay and similarly I'm going to copy the code um I'm going to create a
variable called API key in that API key variable I'm just going to um store the
key value which I copied from my file creation so this should be
unique just click on API key and va so once you all done successfully
over here please let me know what I have to
okay all done okay okay now at this point if I run this code I should not get any
error if I get any error then something is wrong with my
code you all done See what we have done now we have just creating the credentials we have generated the API
key from the Watson X service and as well as we are just creating the URL
where the ML machine Watson machine learning has been running the endpoint so we are using US south uh so that is
why it will be obviously showing for everyone so it should be US southcloud iibbm.com so if you are working with
different domain then uh the the URL should change accordingly
Make sure uh since we are working on the same domain US south the URL should be like this and API key um the unique key
which you have generated from the IBM cloud account okay after this I'm going to create a dictionary in that
dictionary I'm going to uh store my URL API key okay so what I'm going to do I'm
going to create a variable called credentials in that credentials variable I'm going to store
my values so I'm just using the same thingy so over here I'm just pasting it up so here I created a dictionary
variable called credentials in that I have uh stored my URL and API key why
I'm doing like this why I have to create a dictionary why I have to create a values like this
why that is not a
problem json format
no to map no answer is very
simple the reason why I'm using dictionary later if I want to utilize
any of the Watson service Watson connection service so instead of calling the URL API separately so here I have a
dictionary simply I can use a dictionary wherever I want to initialize the Watson Watson service connection that is the
reason here we are just creating the dictionary okay where to get the URL where did you
generate your um API key just above you can find your URL
all done till this shall we move
forward yes exactly
hitisham madan Prasad you can give any name choice is yours
for generating the API key okay now we'll move on to the next
step so so far we just imported we are just authenticated our machine learning
uh with the credentials the notebook authenticated its credentials with the machine learning now it's time to load a
pre-trained model and data set so that we can able to send and receive the request uh securely between the IBM
platform and the um
notebook and make a point see uh this learning purpose I'm creating this uh
application I'm showing my uh API key publicly to you all but whenever you're
creating any API key please never ever share your API key in public maybe not
even a screenshot okay so this API key is kind of a password you have to treat like a password so keep it very secure
okay now we just going to connect and test the
model so whenever you create a project okay
every notebook in IBM Watson is uh linked to a project workspace Okay that
project workspace has a unique ID that Watson uh use okay so with that unique
ID you can able to track the resources you can able to manage the permissions whoever can able to access the
particular project so with that you can know the context of the operation which model what kind of data you are
accessing who is accessing which data all this can be done with the help of this project ID so now what I'm going to
do I'm going to fetch my um project ID what is my project ID okay uh maybe uh
can I show the code at once and can can I explain it or do you want me to drop
it line by line how do you want i go with your
choice line by line perfect so first I'm just going to u
import a module called OS okay what this module will do this module will load all
the module like all the previous module and it will access this module with your
environment variable you all know very well what is environment variable
right so here I'm just importing okay in this point if I run my code it
should not throw any error okay there is application is not throwing any error i'm going to import
OS okay so what this will do this will load the module with that module you can
able to access the environment variable okay so what I'm going to do I'm going to fetch the environment project ID so
whatever project you're creating in the Watson will be stored in the environment with a unique ID okay so I'm going to
fetch that uh ID from the environment so for that I'm going to use try catch
method or try except method
okay so here I just uh in in try I created a variable called project ID so
in this project id with the module OS I'm going to access the environment
value variable called project ID okay if I find any error then it will throw this
message now let me run the code okay so no errors as of now i didn't get
my array project ID now I'm going to print my project ID so if you call the
variable project ID it will show your ID please copy this ID this ID is also
important copy and paste in a notepad later on we will be using
it hope you all clear till this if anything is not clear please let
me know
uh it is throwing an error
see it seems like you made a typo uh please check it
properly okay if not uh if possible can I share this code in chat so they can use it up
okay it is fixed
right why could not be manually enter the project ID because uh this project ID is man
manually generated even if you want see whenever you're creating a project at the top you could see your project ID as
well see over here from here also you can take it up but still I just wanted as a see over here it will be like a 16
digits of uh letter numbers a combination of that okay very precisely
I just want to know my that is the reason we just extracting it from the environmental variable how it is stored
in the uh
environment understood So all
done uh please make sure your uh variable like how did you call the
variable if there is any uh mis case then it will not print okay uh let me quickly explain
what this will do see as of now we are just created the credentials now we are just going to connect and test the model
but now we going to import the data set and we're going to connect that data set with the machine uh what's in machine
learning uh environment through that first I should know where my project has been stored and it should the the the
fundamental model environ I mean the environment and the what's next has to communicate each other right so in
what's inex whenever you're creating a project whenever you're creating a notebook it will stored in the form of
projects right so all the projects stored in a workspace we call it as a workspace so every project has its
unique ID okay with the help of this unique ID you can easily able to track
the resource manage the permission collaborate with your uh fellow uh teammate you can able to see the context
of the operation all can be done in the project okay so then uh we do have we
are just going to find my project ID what was my ID okay so first to do to
know that I should have the access to environ uh access sorry I should have
the access to uh the particular environment the what's AI environment okay to access that environment I am
using a module called OS so what this module will do this module will give you the access for the environment variable
so through this module you can able to access all the environment variable in the what'ssu okay now I'm going to fetch
the ID right now I have the access to get into the what's next environment so over there I'm going to fetch the ID so
for that I'm just going to use try except method okay so in try block I'm just going to create a variable called
project id so through that I'm trying to fetch the project project ID from the environment okay so in except method if
the uh if the operation is fails then it will ask you to enter the ID
manually so this method works both in cloud as well as
local you can fetch automatically or you can um add
locally and below that I'm just displaying the project ID it has
captured in the
variables now if you all done with this now we'll move on to the next step okay you want me to scroll up
once not the first line
huh you should not get a blank you should get a project ID
if it is not working properly then uh there is some mistake uh you're not able to access the environment if you're not
getting any error maybe it's taking some time to fetch the detail
see if the dry block fails at least it has to manually ask you to fetch the value right sorry enter the value if
that is also not working which means your code is fine but it's take time to load on your in your
uh book so maybe I can give you the same
code please try once see here I have given this block
separate separately and project ID separately please note that
also I have given the code in chat
okay now we're going to see how to upload the data set into your WhatsApp
IBM Watsonx workspace okay this is very crucial um please listen carefully and
note down the steps so so far we are just created the
credentials through the credentials we are connected with the Watson and we have set the project ID now we all ready
to uh load our data set
shall we move move forward
okay first I'm going to import a model called type i guess most of you are very
comfortable with this uh types
import maybe I can just copy paste
okay so in first import we have just provided the access uh two types which
means you're going to create some dynamic modules uh we are going to sorry we not going to create we are just going
to use some dynamic modules but we just going to use some dynamic classes so for that if you want to provide access to
those dynamic type definition then we need this type so that is the reason we have imported types okay and the
secondary we going to manipulate the data set in a form of data frames right so Python cannot handle it by its own so
we need a library called pandas so we are importing pandas as pd you can give
any allies
name okay and then uh we have used from bootcode dotclient import config what
this will do see we are going to access the cloud yeah in uh in cloud we're just
going to import my data set from the uh from the cloud i'm going to access it up
okay so this is the low-level core library uh which was used by AWS okay so
um so here we have the boot B3 SDK so with this we just going to
configure the um how the client has to behave so you
can set the timeouts region signature verification everything can be done in
over here and we are using IBM B3 so this is
very compatible version of BH3 the one which we have installed earlier and this is from Amazon amazon SDK for AWS okay
this will help you to access the IBM cloud storage because in the IBM cloud we're going to import our data okay so
for that we need it up so if you want to upload download
manage file in IBM clouds then we need this IBM boto3
all done we'll import
this yeah it should be in the same uh same
order okay after this
You all done till this
okay now we need to create the bucket IBM cloud bucket inside that bucket only
we can able to put our uh data set
okay oh by mistake just a minute
um so without knowingly I just exporting the option
uh unfortunately closed
it okay so once you done with all the basic uh configuration now what you have
to do um let me share the code with you
so we need to fetch this bucket and the object key value and this endpoint
URL and your API key api key you have to copy from your
code so I'm just removing
that so I just give this code to you i have given this code in
chat please utilize this code just copy paste it i will tell you how to create the bucket how to create the object ID
everything
all done shall I proceed
once you ready please update me we move forward
yes over here uh you have the IBM API key ID this is same as the uh API key
which you have created over here so you have to copy this API key ID which you have already created right
copy this key and put it here
okay see how this config is working this config is working because of of this IBM
boot okay so the IBM BHO and BO code this help like it is kind of uh helps
Python to talk to your IBM cloud storage S3 compatibility
so over here you have CO_CL client equal to IBM uh BHO.client service name entry
okay what this will do this is the uh it's a kind of authentication you're
creating a client to access files from your IBM cloud3 bucket so now let me
show you how to create the uh bucket i'm just sharing
my So this is my IBM dashboard so go to your IBM dashboard
so once you all landed there
That is I'm teaching Arian please get into your IBM cloud you all want a break
okay let's take a 10 minutes break come back by 6:30 i I I teach you what to have to put
in IBM sorry URL endpoint URL what has to be put in um next two things
so since many of you asked for the break in the chat I'm just giving you 10 minutes break thank you Amita i will
announce you by 6:30 once you from back from your break I will give you the announcement important announcement
yes thank you like thank you Chi thank you Kit
Sham Arian thank you for reminding me once you all back from your break I will
give the important announcement
so welcome back to the
session shall we continue
all right so regarding the Yes Amita I'm coming to the point regarding the important announcement tomorrow is a
holiday due to Bakrit okay
uh that is the important yashan leaves are not important to
you are you seriously asking this question midra are you kidding me
okay jokes apart we'll focus on the task coming back to the task so once you all uh get into the dashboard over here just
go to the catalog okay and then search for the
product cloud
if you search for uh cloud it will show cloud object storage so you have to select this
service go to IBM dashboard from the dashboard you have to search for the
service cloud object
storage okay so over here it will by default there will be many buckets you
can also create your own bucket so what you have to do just click on the but uh
button create bucket and then from here first option
create a custom bucket select on create bucket create on custom bucket so by
default it will give a unique name if you want you can change the name but make sure it is following this naming
rule okay and region let let it uh let as it is as delas and click on create
don't change anything else just bucket name everything click on
create oh yeah it is created once the bucket has been created
now what we have to do we have to configure that so go to
configure scroll down over here we do have regular endpoint so from the
regular endpoint take the public endpoint URL if you notice here you
cannot find anything called HTTP but when you're adding that to your code you
have to add
HTTP just copy this public code URL come back to your WhatsApp X and over here just paste
the endpoint URL okay and regarding the
bucket go back to your cloud from there copy your bucket
name come back paste it here
so all done regarding the object ID I'll let you know please wait
don't understand when I sometimes you are asking me to uh talk fast sometimes
you're asking me to slow okay let me say it again please follow the
steps okay so remember did you all complete till
creating the bucket please update
Okay okay so let's go step by step
um so this is our IBM cloud dashboard right so here what you have to do go to
catalog okay from here s search for not here over here search for
cloud so automatically it will drop cloud object storage so select cloud
object storage go to IBM dashboard click on catalog from there search IBM cloud
storage
once you complete this please update
me a go to IBM cloud dashboard
oh I'm so
sorry go to dashboard click on cat block
search for I
uh cloud cloud object
storage search for cloud object
storage you'll be getting this screen once you're all
done thank you Maddie thank you for letting me
know i forgot to switch back to the screen
see bias it's not cloud storage object it's cloud object
storage search properly
okay so hope all create got this page
please update me whether you got this page or not
okay so once you have completed this okay so over here you do have the
option called create bucket can you see here this option so click on create
bucket scroll down from there very first option create a requirement so click on
create um by default it will give you a unique name if you want you can keep up
the name or if you want to change it up you can change according to the naming
policy scroll down don't change anything else please
don't change anything else it has to be in uh the last region scroll down scroll
down to the last oh
okay once once you're done with the naming you have to click on create bucket once you're done with the naming
you have to click on create bucket
okay uh once it is done once the bucket has been created here you could see the bucket name you can copy and keep it in
a notepad okay then just go to the configuration go to the configuration
scroll down over here you do have regular endpoints okay so if you want to host
your application to be in a private we have to take private okay but we are just going to use a public resource
