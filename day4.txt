up please wait first of all let me share the link prologon access link in chat
please click on the link and then I will share the credential
okay so here I have shared the credential in chat
so far I have not give any assignment
panch link is not opening
see here I'm just giving the link on chat please click on the link the site will be
open if not please try in incognitive window
see if you have any issue with uh not getting the uh link for joining the
session please drop you have a dedicated WhatsApp group for that right you can drop your text over
there yes one sec let me give the ID and password so the ID is your registered
email ID the ID is your registered email ID
please use your registered email
ID please use your registered email ID and I have shared the password
so I have this is a common password later on you can change your password according to your preference i will show
you how to change the password preference and
all i will share the link in chat
so I have shared the credentials in
chat the ID and the username should be your registered email ID and password
should be slot one at IBM geni we can change the password little as per your
preference
did you all open i'm It's not opening start is not working
see site has not been crashed siting is working very fine even uh please do
check your internet once
okay no worries let me share you one link okay so in that link please do try
uh do fill all your queries okay if you're not able
to see if site is not opening try to open that in incognito
window is working it's well and good
okay in chat I have shared the credentials to login your
prolog give your registered email id and password use the uh password which I
have given later on we can change
So
Okay let me share you one um link in
chat those who are having issue with the prologue access please drop your queries
on this Google form we will fix on it i have shared a Google form in chat those
who are having issue with your um login credentials please drop it in the form
so if you did not receive the login credential then in that form you have to mention not received
see those who have not received the LMS credentials via email please fill the
form
uh I'm sharing the see I'm sharing the form once again
please click on the sorry please fill the form if you have any issues with the
prologue so once you all done then let me know
so you all fill the uh form Google form
see IBM C access will be received by end of this week
only if the site is not see if anything wrong with the site please fill the
Google form which I have shared please don't drop the um problem in the textbook inbox i cannot help you only
the technical team can help you on this whatever queries whatever issue that you are facing with the IBM uh prollearn
access please fill the Google form which I have shared in the
group yes you have to fill the form even though you didn't receive the credential
the LMS prolon is the
LMS see so far you have received the credential only for the LMS ibm C is
different that credential will be received over the weekend okay lms is a
uh uh it's it's it's a common term and name of our LMS is
prollearn learning management system is a common portal where where the learning has been happen uh prlearn is an LMS we
can say UDM is also see whatever issue that you are
facing with
this Again many are asking the same thing lms and prolong is same or different kind of LMS is a normal word
okay it's a generic word okay prollearn is LMS see we used to say is database
database is a common name so for the database we have MongoDB SQL MySQL
similarly LMS is a common name where Prollearn is the one of the LMS
even though if you're able to sign in you just fill the form that you have not received the
credentials Again don't drop your queries regarding the sites not opening
pages not opening if you drop the text in chat I'm so sorry I couldn't help you on that part please fill the
form it's working well and
good yes uh
shrinat ramkumar just now I told you please don't drop your queries in the
chat indeed just fill the
form did you did you receive any credentials via
email sure i will send the form once again
those who are having issue with Google uh with prolong access those who didn't receive the credentials via
email please share it LMS means learning management
system there's no option to drop
see the form is very straightforward do do your LMS do did you receive the
credential or not if you didn't receive the credential
Just mention that you have not received the credential via
email if you have not received any credentials please drop in the
form i have shared the form once again in chat
yes basically if you are able to log in but still uh you didn't receive the mail
right please fill the form that you have not received the
mail if it is not working please fill the Google form
has been taken adita thank
you i have shared the link
yes yes yeah uh finish if it is not work uh if you didn't receive the email still you have
to fill the
form if you didn't get any reminders from the Zoho please use a WhatsApp group there you can uh drop your query
Okay now let me explore uh let let me show you the prologue access those who
not received the credential you please make a note of it once you received your credential you can
um you can go through it okay so this is your
um LMS right this is your site so over here at the left corner you could see
your name abbreviated so if you click on your name you uh you could see the dashboard profile grades everything will
be there so over there you do have the option called preference okay you need to click on the
preference so there you have the option of changing the password
got it so how how to navigate to this preferences over here you have to click
on your name there uh fifth option you you could see preferences okay so just
click on the preferences and you can see the change
password so you can change your password okay and how to navigate to your course
left hand side you have the menu bar over there just click on my courses and
from there you have to choose IBM VIT gena slot one okay so over here you
could see the session recordings so all the session recordings will be uploaded over here as of now you have only one
recording has been no all the three recordings are
there so if you click on this um
YouTube link will be open over there you can see
that yeah it's completely fine you can change a password but once you change a password do remember your password okay
if you are regularly attending the sessions then it is not required to uh see
the
recordings guy it I think it's only 10 minutes ago that you have filled the
form right so had at least give me 15 to 20 minutes the team has been uh diagnosing it once they're done they
will be sharing their credentials
okay all right so over here in this um below to
your okay below to your session recordings we're going to add all the
study materials so inside the study materials you can see maybe I can show
you some other
courses so below to this you will be having one
sec okay fine so below to this you will be having all your study materials
assignments assessment project you know that right by end of this course you're
going to make a many project in ji uh so those document will be sh you have to
upload in this LMS only okay
all right so if you have any doubts regarding this prologue access you can drop your doubts in chat hardly only
five minutes will be taken to resolve all your uh queries
so shall we start today's session
okay you want a feedback uh no worries we will be collecting feedback uh in
periodically if you want to share the feedback right away you can share it in the chat it's a private window i can
only see your chat uh meanwhile I will enable the option of sharing the
feedback soon
yes I will share you once again how to change a
password okay ra Maheshwari we are just exploring the
prologus uh this is a site where you can see your uh session material which we
are discussing in classroom the session recordings your assignments quiz and the
capstone project that we going to do in the
course uh maybe by end of this day you can see your module one uh PPTs over
here still I have not uploaded this course material once uh maybe by end of
this day I will upload the uh course
material assignments i will show you maybe
So all your assignments will comes under this
so I have created the topics below the each topic um the uh the datas will be
uploaded as of now there is no assignment to you all which is marked for evaluation
lms is not working please complete filter
form percentage did I show any percentage criteria no I have not shown anything like that if I'm not wrong
man I'm not shown anything i have not shown any percentage criteria i'm so
sorry
so if your super is all sorted can we start the session
okay what do we discuss in the last class can anyone uh drop in the chat what do we discuss in the last
class in last class we have completed the U module one
so what are the things that we have covered in that
What is the difference between CNN and RNN
yes advantage and disadvantages okay transformers are the UI are really very good sequence sequence to sequence good
transformers very good very good good all of
you perfect
men okay if I want to uh create a chart bot then which one will be the right
option to do with CNN or RNN
very good CNN
Vishwa Vishu Dhman no you have given the wrong answer not CNN it's RNN
Very good so in today's class we're going to learn uh about what's an X okay
ibm what's an X so have you ever heard about the term IBM what's an
X no worries it will not affect okay just a minute let me share
my screen uh let me share the PPT
okay
are you able to see my PPT
i was not able to do that again
yeah please just a minute just a minute i'm
giving hope it is visible to you all is my PP is visible to you all
kabir if you didn't get the login credentials fill the
form yes thank you
imagine so you are building a smart system okay uh for a for a company
you're just going to build a application that application is going to generate the uh
grades with some trusted data that is called as IBM Watson okay uh maybe I
just forgot to share this first of all so in today's session you're going to understand what is IBM Watson AI and
what is the purpose of it okay and you're going to learn how to build a Gen AI with Watson AI okay how to create
some application how to build some Gen AI applications with Watson AI okay and
we're going to explore some real world use cases of WhatsApp AI and we're going to sign up the account it's a cloud
account okay IBM cloud account we're going to sign up the IBM cloud account and we just going to understand the
process the process for data preparation to data deployment a real world end to
end uh ML development cases okay these are the things that we're going to learn in today's class actually there is a
typo um I will change it up
so this is what we're going to learn in today's class
okay so IBM what's an AI it's a tool this tool help you to create the um
genai uh projects okay so imagine if you're working for an organization and
in that organization if you want to create some application some automated gen application then this is the right
tool okay with the help of this tool you can create some trusted enter entrepreneurship datas okay and you can
automate the process with the help of AI application which means you can create the application in this tool and that
tool can automate the process okay so are you all clear with what is
um IBM what's
next so it is a AI development environment in this with the help of this environment you can able to build
you can able to manage AI applications and machine learning
models just
visualize how to create the account what
accountity so did you all understand what is ji I'm sorry I uh what's an next
I'll let you know
do anyone have the okay do anybody have doubt on how what
is uh IBM what's next so what is IBM what's
next yes you can do it
up yes it is a environment in this environment you can able to
create gen applications
okay so if you want to build a machine learning models what are the other tools that we have
so we can use tools like Jupyter notebook auto AI or we can use some
visual workflows to create the model machine learning model from the scratch to automate process in what's next so
within what's in next you will be having Jupyter notebook
autoai so uh with the help of Watson X you can you can able to build machine
learning models yeah
you can build some uh foundation model what is foundation model by the
way where you can create some JA applications
yes sad it is on is there any problem
so with help of Watson AI you can able to create end to end ML applications
where you can prepare the data where you can train valid and deploy all you all the process from the scratch to
deployment you can do everything within the what's
And you can govern the AI application which means you can uh file check the applications you can create the
complaint dashboards bias reduction you can do all this in your uh tool in this
partic one tool itself so to do all this from where we
will getting the data okay so to generate the data for IBM what's index we do have a separate tool and that tool
is called as IBM what's next data so this data help you to generate some uh
sorry this tool help you to generate some data which can be used for the uh project purpose so it's a it's a kind of
have you used Kaggle did you all know Kaggle
okay so if you're doing any data visualization so in Kaggle you can get some free data sets similarly for the
what's next you can get the data set from this what's the next
data so this is a simple what's next service architecture okay so by default
this blue one this is the core
services okay so the blue box is is a core uh core services and the pink there
is a pink color box right can you all able to see the color
differentiation okay uh so so the pink box is like focused on
responsible what are the things which we can achieve through this okay and the
last one is co common core functionality with the help which is supported by the
uh what's next okay now let's explore one after
the other so the core functionality of what's xi is where you can prepare
data which means uh from the data set you can clean transform and get ready
your data for the training okay and then you can work with models so there you
can build ML models and generate content with the foundation models so remember
what is foundation
model and then you can automate the model life cycles which means train deploy and monitor all can be happen in
one place actually so that is prepare data work with model
automate model life
cycle and you have the next section which is called as deployed foundation models so there you are computing which
means resource to run and large model train large model okay and we have
interfacing so we will be using some pre-trained models so if you how many of
you have chance of working with VEX robot have you heard about this VEX
robots okay not Rex it's
Wex okay i just forgot about
it so this computer is for training and fine-tune process and this um
interference is like inferencing is just where some pre-trained models will be available you
can use those pre-trained modules and from that you can get some insights for your
input okay now let's look into the pink color box which is responsible kit AI
toolkit okay so over here you can able to monitor the tools which means you can
track how your model performs over the time and we have track model so in that
track model you can record the model lineage update and changes and you know
what we do have the option called invite users which means you can collaborate with your team yeah and multiple people
can work in one particular
project how do we do in GitHub same same thing same collaboration can be happened
here
and then resource usage so we have two thing one is model evaluation and model
explanation so in model evaluation we will test the model accuracy fairness
and performance okay in model explanation we can understand why the
model made a decision
hope you're clear with the responsible AI toolkit shall I move on to the next
one it is not exactly like version controller version control is something different where you can uh see version
control is different than uh tool collaborator github is version controller this is not a version
controller in GitHub you can see if something is not working you can uh switch to the previous version of the
particular application here you cannot do that you can collaborate your work among your
teammates is my voice audible to everyone
yes I thank
you okay now we're just going to see the common components
the last one common core functionality of this uh WhatsApp
X so we have workspace so in this workspace uh just like shared
environment where you can organize your projects
okay so administration where you will you will be having multiple roles like
managing role access resource everything will be there in the administration in
simple you can user and role managements will be there and in storage you can find the data and model storage
uh you you can um you can store data sets model outputs
your notebooks
So in connectivity you can able to integrate your data source securely
which means if you want to integrate uh with other system you can do it very securely and you do have some sample
templates uh some example projects that could speed up your onboarding creating
your very first project so in short we can say just
think of what's in here is like a kitchen okay where the chef is a data scientist okay he going to cook some
premium ingredient which is the data and the recipes which is
model and over here you have the that is what's an AI okay what's next AI so at
the bottom you do have the what's next governance right that is a food safety inspector who will be ensuring every
dish is healthy fair approved for the customers that that is your users and user and we have the core services that
core services are like just power water tools that keeps the kitchen
running hope this example could able to connect with the uh tools and services over
here this is my current slide i'm just explaining this only ibm Watson X
services architecture once more
okay see here I have three services in Watson right which are Watson X AI
Watson X governance and core functionality just imagine uh we are in
a kitchen okay so if what's next itself it's a kitchen okay so because what's
the next AI is a tool that we going to use right so that is a kitchen where chef is data scientist so data scientist
is a chef who going to cook some premium uh who going to cook using some premium
ingredients like data and the recipe with the data they're going to make a recipe called models okay it can be any
model so models okay so what do this what's the next governance will do that is a food safety inspector which will be
ensuring every dish is healthy fair and approved for the customers which is the end users okay and we have the core
services right the pink one so the blue one so those are the essentials uh that
runs that keep the kitchen running like water power
tool okay can I ask you One
question let me raise you a poll
just a minute i just raised the board
so I have started a poll so which role that describes your interest in what's
in X
Okay so 75%age has given the core like they want to be a AI engineer and only
36% has given just exploring AI okay and
78%age has given Okay let me publish the result
okay
now let's understand how to develop a generative AI solution okay so left hand
side we do have the traditional AI and right hand side we have the foundation model so what do the traditional AI will
do
okay so let me give you one task okay if you want to train a AI to write a poem
email and the code okay uh would you prefer to train three different models
or you will create one model that can do all of it
one
model okay someone wants to create three model and some wants to create only one
again it's different from the person perspective
perspective so persontoperson perspectives um so if you ask
me I will create one model which can do all the three times
saver uh my user can also perform multiple things at one place
okay very good
so with the help of AI models you can uh either create
like with the help of traditional AI model you can train one model for a specific task for example if you want to
develop some uh text prediction you can do only with text if you're doing some
AI which can generate image that can do only one things uh so uh traditional AI
specifically train for one specific task okay so you have to create different models if you want to achieve with
different set of outputs okay and over we do have some model specification you
cannot use multiple model create at one task
so literally what is the drawback when you want to create three different models it takes some time time consuming
yeah we need some in uh resource in intensive yeah to for every new task we
have to build a new model so that was a main drawback that we could see uh traditional AI model okay when come
comes to foundational AI which is gen
AI so it's a single uh with the help of a single foundational model which is a
pre-trained on on a large set of data you could create multiple task with one
one just because this foundation model learns from wide data so then we just
using the prompting to adapt the model like translating text generation code
generation so we can say one general purpose model very quick adaption with
prompting and we need very less uh for task specific
retain so if you want you can uh you can
um we can take it as an example so at home we do have the toolbox right so we
can compare traditional AI is just with the uh multispecialized toolbox where we
can find screwdriver wrench hammer so every different tool for every different
task yeah and whereas we can uh find this foundation model just like Swiss
army knife okay it's a one powerful tool that adapt to many task with just small
switches that switches is called as prompt we will be using some prompt where we can uh do the task so why we
are preferring this foundation model it's very faster to time because we no need to train the data from the scratch
okay it's very easy to maintain because it's just only one model we going to monitor update and govern at all the
time okay and compared to the cost um development cost it's costsaving because
it's less compute and training data needed for for every task
so now let's understand the end toend AI workflow from the IBM sorry within the
IBM what's next AI okay so in this tool itself you can create the end to end a
complete AI application geni application the very first stage is prepare and
share data build and train model deploy automate the sorry prompt function uh
foundation model uh tune foundation model automated ML life
cycle so let's see one after the other
why we have to prepare data why data prep-processing is important
very good to just fetch the important okay to extract the important data very
good very good good answers
so in data preparation what we will be okay that is a our first step in uh ML
life cycle okay so what we will be doing we will be gathering the datas right uh
let's take an example you are going to build a loan eligibility assistance you're going to build an application and
that application is going to assist with the loan eligibility so how do you uh collect your data set
so we will collect the uh datas like customers customers we suppose uh we have to collect the customer data set
right the customer's name age salary credit score past loan history yeah so
from that what we will be checking we will be checking the null values yeah uh
so that this is called as data preparation so we are just insighting the data inest the data and clean the
unstructed ructured unstructured data hope you all know the difference between structured and unstructured data i think
the very first class I have explained to you all from Kaggle imagine you're going to work in a
for a real time uh project how could you take the data from Kaggle
sidat without any noise i didn't get you Ashita
you are a bank
you're going to create a loan eligibility application for a bank concerned so that bank will be having
all the data how could you take the data from the data set uh sorry Kaggle Kartik
area if you're going to practice something in that scenario you can take it from
Kaggle all right
so hope you are clear with what is data
preparation the next step is model selection and training okay so we can
say it as model selection and prompt engineering okay so for this what we will be doing first of all we have to
choose the right foundational model for the particular project okay
after then you have to start prompting the model with sample inputs like um uh
how how it can perform for that particular task okay and after uh doing the training you can see how it is
evaluating the output relevant to the prompts which you are giving uh let's take the same example this loan uh
assistant prompt okay so if you give the prompt like given a customer age 35 uh
salary 80k okay and credit score is 700 should they be eligible for a personal
loan so we have to use the prompt lab to evaluate the response and re redefine
the proper uh prompt format
okay I hope you clear with the second
stage set to the image we can you can use Kaggle data set i just ask you on a
scenario based question for that particular scenario you cannot use Kaggle
okay moving to the next
model tuning and customization so here we just upload the
labeled examples and we will be fine-tuning the model for the tone accuracy and format for example um we
will be giving uh we will be fine-tuning the model with several uh inputs
you will customize the model behavior for the specific particular need okay how it has to behave how the model can
be go better how it can be domain
specific and the next step is uh deployment and interference
so here what we will be doing we will be deploying the prompt or the tuned model at at an end points so we will be using
either python or any resty API uh to invoke this in a real time
uh checking up and we are deploying it in a and once you deploy it will come to the use of people where people can use
it up so once it is deployed our job is not done we have to monitor how it perform in the real time that is
concerned of monitoring and feedback looping so over here we will be uh track the application usage yeah uh we will be
check the latency we will be checking the accuracy metrics okay so we also used to collect the user feedbacks for
every uh future tuning
so now let's create your IBM cloud account i'm just stop sharing the
screen okay now uh let us
do first let's build the uh IBM cloud account okay to do that uh we do have a
dedicated
um okay I'm just sharing the link in chat and I want one volunteer person who
can give the credential so that I can show in my screen
so so who is ready to share your credentials so that I can show in my screen no worries the chatter is
completely private your password the OTP will not be shared with anyone else
no I don't want I want the person okay the first person who has
volunteer please stop sharing the ids in chat kindly don't do
that okay
see I I never purposely ignore
anyone okay for next few seconds please others don't drop any text in chat i
want only the person Satak Satakumar has to share all the
credentials i have not said anything on my screen i just stop sharing my screen i have I'm just giving a link in chat
please click on the link and Satak please share me your uh
official college mail id which you used for sign
up okay so once you click on the link which I have shared in the chat what you have
to do you have to scroll down to the
last just a second
so over here you have the option access software download so you
have to click on
this okay once you click this here you have to use your official ID your
college official ID which you have used for the course enrollment then click submit
i'm just checking whether um you people receive the credential or
not it seems can anyone any other share the
credential we are not done with the session we are just signing up IBM cloud account
copy
image guys which means you have not received the credentials okay I will push it from
the uh my side then we can do this on tomorrow do any other have the
credentials can I get one more credential to check it up one last time okay
Mul I'm
sorry for him it is
working anyone
uh when you give the ID did you all receive this did anyone receive this something like the registration
form did anyone receive the registration
form okay it is working from VIT bal not from Okay understood
Aditya so if you are from VIT Ballal then it will be working and for the persons who are from VIT channel it is
not working understood understood thanks
Adita for making the picture clear
so in that case let's wait for others too let's not do this right away okay so
let's wait for others so we can do this um
tomorrow got it tomorrow we can do the process of sign up now let's do some
activity in um with Python okay i'm just stop
sharing my screen
now let's create a simple
chatbot
python so shall we do the task
okay let me let me ask the team to check on this so let's not worry about it we will do it tomorrow
check tomorrow only we going to create the
process and reminder this task we I'm not going to give any marks for this
task this task is completely for our understanding purpose okay to understand things much better we are doing this
task can you all try this in incognito window
Can you all try that in incognito window once ali can you please share your uh
credential academic ID maybe I can try in my screen
tanish if you are from VIT buper it will
work arty are you there okay no need of password now you
can keep the password with you
aya you're from Chennai uh VIT
Chennai it is working fine for you
okay so shall we complete the process so uh just just just for the record I'm
asking for how many of you it is not working drop that
only please drop your um query in
WhatsApp okay noted not working not working
okay can you all please try once with uh incognito
window yes good idea
i have rised the pole
this please don't pro don't don't proceed with the um uh sign up registration process if you miss one
step you cannot if you fill anything wrong even then you cannot sign up the
uh process successfully so please don't do that
i just ask you to check whether it is proceeding to the next once you give your ID it should proceed to the next
page
just a second quickly and create a
Okay 50/50 so around 43 percentages has given
yes and 56% has given no those who said no can you please put what you got on
your screen so once you click on the link when you give the um uh register uh I
mean your registered email id your what is the response that you got in your screen please drop that in
chat please wait don't fill the
form yes let me share my
Three so once you uh can I get any other ID those who said no can you please give
any one of your ID something went wrong something went wrong refuse to connect
okay
okay so which means it is not
working so some other ID
Okay let me give you one um Google
form please fill that
one sec
oh
okay just a
second understood uh okay
nadam was why you are dumping with the same text inside uh in the chat box can
you please explain what is happening you cannot uh sign up that particular account with Gmail account
she stopped spamming the inbox with the same
message okay let me give you a task the task is you have to create a chatbot using
Python create a chatbot using Python
i just give the task in chat box
the rulebased
chatbot you have to complete the task in the session itself
