Right so Praalian like regarding this payment issue like you have to convey
that in the WhatsApp group you do all have the WhatsApp group right please uh confirm in that
group so those queries will be sorted over there
very good to manipulate datas and develop it to very good
okay so today let's create the um what's next uh application let's
let's sign up with the IBM cloud so WhatsApp is a part of IBM cloud so inside the IBM cloud we have this tool
WhatsApp we'll see how to uh sign up into it okay
every time you need to see it is not like every time you need to uh like um if you want to join the
session you have to register the Zoho like with your registered email id you have to register the zoo for the very
first time okay if you register it and you will be getting the proper notification from the Zoho link to the
registered mail
ID can you please uh drop your question again because I missed your question
attent is not
compulsory okay I will I will check with the technical team regarding this Zoho issue and once it is sorted I'll let you
know by tomorrow
okay attenance is not compulsory okay arian if your
credentials showing invalid I have shared the uh link right form Google
form link in that link please update your query okay it will be sorted by the
technical
team i will show you how to access your PPTs
understood even though you're not able to uh access the proland please fill the
form which will be sorted by the backend team I'm giving the form link in
chat please use
Okay so in today's session let's create um WhatsApp next first let's sign up
with the IBM cloud account once we done that uh what's next is a part one of the
product in IBM cloud okay over there we can explore what's the next first let's see how to create the cloud account
um let me check whether you all received the credential you all have the access first let me give you one link in chat
just click on the link and try to put your email id remember in the last class we did the same right if you find any
challenges then we'll look what can we do next um just a
Okay okay
just a second i'm just giving the
link
okay so I have shared the link in chat please click on the link
to to show the demo i need any one of your ID
oh many of you have shared the degree maybe I will take the very
eta i'm taking your credentials so you have to share the details whenever it is
required okay so over here once you land this page here you do have the option
called access software download so you have to click on this
get reload to a page where here you have to drop your ID okay once you done click on
submit yeah I just take the screenshot
let me try once
again okay so how many of you are facing issues like this uh just a minute let me
raise the poll so you can answer in the poll
so please respond to the poll
arti yesterday only we have check I checked with your ID there is no problem it it works
fine can anyone else give me another ID those who are facing issue can you please give me your ID i will check it
once
okay so those who are facing Okay uh here okay maybe let's Sanju San maybe I check with this
one more ID
see if it is not working for the very first time try to reload your page once
and try again see just now I faced the issue for this angel when I try to reload my pa uh page and try with the
same ID it is working fine can you all please try those who are facing the issue with this um skill network can you
please reload your page once or try to open this uh um link in incognito window
and try it once again i guess it is working fine maybe I take
Aish okay so I'm just reloading this
page and I'm trying once again
i open a window in
incognito i just take
the ID
God I'm sick
so once it is done here let's check with the same
ID yes uh mean you you can try with uh refreshing the screen two or three times
then if you check with the same ID it is working now can you all update this poll
maybe I just regenerate it
Please try to refresh refresh the screen
twice just okay make sure while copying you should
not have any uh white space
still 50%age of the people are facing
issue okay can I show you how to sign up the uh skill network maybe for those who
are not working you can refer the I will I will share the uh document in prolon
access as well and once your ids are sorted you can see the recording and you can try it
once no worry once everyone is ready with the tour I will start the
um pro pro in the WhatsApp next
sometimes uh there will be a network issue sometimes the server might be bit
down oh understood
so okay understood now can I um I'll just go with the poll again
shall we be
Okay can I show you how to create the IBM cloud account like those for those who are having issue no worries I will
share the detailed document as well as the recordings will be there you can check from the recordings um and you can
create a little later once everyone is ready with the account I will start the practicals till then we will be uh
waited like we will be on hold for everyone to join with
us see only uh 47 percentage of people are like voting i want uh everyone to
vote for this
yes Sanju like it is opening very well in my
system it is not like that actually uh everything is working only when see when
there is a server when uh if there is a net traffic sometime the site might be
bit slow it doesn't mean it is not working is
slow probably you all will receive your IBM C uh credentials in couple of
is mid please wait
see uh Ghana if you are absent on if you are absent on yesterday please go through the recordings recordings are
there in the uh your prologue please refer the recordings of course I will be
uh recap of what we have learned on the previous
Bless okay let me check the poll once again only 70%age of people are
ordered so out of 553 over here only 382 have been voted for
this okay I will show you how to create this um account IBM account
okay I stop share the screen
so I have randomly take one ID from the
Add stop sharing by
mistake okay
so yesterday this ID was working fine now it is not
working okay hey can you please any can anyone please give some other
ID okay I just go with the very first ID
ID just a second give me a minute
i'm sorry for the interruption um okay i take service
ID it should not be like this it's Did you complete the um registration process
straightly taking me to the signup page can you please respond in chat
chita okay no worries then I will try with someone else who have not completed it so it will be helpful for everyone uh
to complete the steps okay um can anyone please share the
link okay randomly I take
one I think uh since I'm just gave from the same
um URL it is not working I guess uh because Um anyhow this uh session ID will be
there right maybe because of that I tried with a fresh
one i could see many of you are chatting in the WhatsApp group that your um pron
access is not working i
understood so uh prol is currently under maintenance like people are working on
it maybe by mid of this night or maybe by tomorrow morning it will be sorted so please wait patiently thank you oh
then is this working harsh
then I just take mantra
okay so over here what you have to choose you have to choose the role as student okay who am I
how okay mantra okay then you have to choose your um course your degree
current degree mantra can you please drop the text like what is your current degree
problem
is mantra are you there in the call btech computer science okay
so Bachelor of Engineering and over here you have to
choose again Bachelor of Engineering so when is your expected graduation
date okay 27
so over here you have to
choose CC or CAC it P tech so
computer science and technology okay yes so over here how to
um accept the terms and condition you have to click on this software terms and
download accept it choose the privacy constant accept it then click on
register over here we'll have to give the ID um can
you please give me the registered email id mantra
it is BTE you have to choose Bachelor of Engineering in first two column the south column and other one and below the
department where you have to choose computer engineering and technology
okay now we uhoh over here we supposed to create the
account password can you please give the password which you want to create it and you can no worries this is a
private chat
mandra if I I missed him if he wrote computer science okay see you can choose
computer science and engineering or computer technology both are fine both are computer stream right
okay i think the password size is yeah it should be 12 in character length minimum 12 can you please adjust your
password accordingly in department you have to
choose Bachelor of Engineering i'm sorry first two column you have to choose Bachelor of Engineering okay and the
third column you will be having something called department so in the department you have to choose your core
um Mantra I missed your Okay I got the password
now correct me if I'm wrong mantra and what is your last
name is it Singh
so company just randomly choose IBM so hope those who are doing along
with me completed till
then choose CSC department
so that's what you have to choose Tanushka like you have to choose uh computer uh computer and
technology so you have to for the enroll me in the IBM batch program yes you have to click on
yes i'm just holding for 5 minutes please others complete till then and if you have any doubts please drop the
doubts
see IBM batch program you have to click on yes
yeah so I think all done can I give next okay once you complete everything click
on next uh Mantra can you please share the sevendigit uh code which you received
with the registered email id
you just mention only IBM that is enough
yes okay thanks Monro so you will be receiving a code
seven-digit code registered email id once it is done you have to click on submit it will take few seconds and the
IBM ID will be created
this is incognitive window i have not created anything okay let me try
okay something wrong
okay check on this once again just a minute give me a minute
i'm sharing the screen let's try mantra can you please
share the ID and password
okay what is what was the password that you have given let's check whether the ID has
been created or
not please share the password mantra yes per company please just
choose IBM
okay
what is your location and this is not the one that we have to go
through everything went well and at a point it is not work properly right
okay um mantra I take your details i try separately you are spending too much of
time on this uh let's work on this little later i hope I will record the complete uh steps
and I will upload you i will share in the WhatsApp group you can try with that okay give me a couple of
days see now it is something went wrong the same ID the server was too busy I
guess so probably um I will take any one of your numbers okay i will try to get
the details from you and I will try to create the recorded video of how to
create the um IBM cloud account okay and I will upload the inroller once it is
fixed or before then I will share that video in WhatsApp with you all you can
try it up once okay i hope you all agree with me
did anyone complete the process successfully oh yeah understood many got
the same screen like me right
okay mantra did you get any registration email ID with a
link no okay then all right so let's start the session um
today's video is going to look about
NLP okay
i think someone got the output like someone able to get into it right
um I can see in WhatsApp group
Okay sakamar can you please share your uh credentials so that I can show people
once okay um Mantra can you please uh can you see any link in that particular
mail
see even if you get any error message like uh IBM ID has been already used by
this application which means later sometime you will be receiving a email to your account so please check that
email you must have some
credentials so no such link in that
mantra is there any
link okay now uh so please click on the
link what is this
okay see once you done even though if you receive something like the account has been uh the application has been
already in you something like that little later you will be receiving one um um mail a confirmation mail to your
registered email id okay so in that register email id you will be having a link to login so you have to click on
the link okay once you click on the link if you click on the link it will be
redirected to the page like this where where is the page I got yeah page like this okay here you
have to do the one-time verification okay for the authentication here I'm going to choose email uh Mantra again
you will be receiving your uh I need your email
id please do share your email id
mantra very good
bios can you please share the uh verification code you you will be receiving an email
[Music]
Okay verification has been done
now let me try to log in again
just a second
your account has been created successfully um
I was not able to get the page again
okay
okay the site is too busy i guess IBM server is quite busy um even I'm not
getting uh you could see that I'm I'm getting the error page when I click on it
okay now let's take a short 10 minutes break we'll join by 6 p.m okay and we'll
start with NLP okay i have not shared my screen actually I'm just trying in another tab
i was not sharing any of my screen uh let's take short 10 minutes break
please join at
6:00 meanwhile if you have those who have any queries you just drop the queries in chat others can take a break
we'll start
no you have to you you don't need to leave just be there in the call but take
10 minutes break come back by 6:00 p.m
um yes don't
knock I could see many are completed the registration process i can see all your WhatsApp chats
if you if you received a mail like clear to clear the IBM catch which means the account has been created wait for some
time you will be receiving it email to the register account yes I'm ready to respond to your
query donor can you please send me what what is your query I couldn't see any of your query
Rishik how do I know your month of graduation look at your ID card from your ID card you can check it up
right arti did you complete the sign up process
i told you already uh prolun is under maintenance give me uh like it will be sorted maybe by uh mid by this midnight
or by tomorrow morning then you can try it
in South degree you have to choose uh engineering bachelor of engineering
company name
IBM know if you received a mail like regist registration was successful uh
there obviously you will be receive a link okay you're supposed to click on the link and next you can log in and
complete the process so once you All done you can able to see the skill board uh once everyone got the particular page
then I will uh tell you the next steps to proceed with
Okay so how many of you completed registration successfully maybe uh let
me raise the poll uh I just
Please complete the poll quickly how many of you have completed the registration
i want everyone to respond this
okay if you made any mistakes on the graduation month that is not a problem no need to worry about
it no scush please wait once you have complete you do have another steps to
follow
see if you have make any mistake on your graduation month that is not a problem
no need to worry about it
only 50% of people has been given the oat what about
others can I take others who are not attentive in the class
okay um so let's take time others please try
whenever you have free time please check with the link and try to complete the uh sign up process okay i want each one of
you to complete the sign up process tomorrow evening so tomorrow let's complete the cloud account side up so
tomorrow let's work on WhatsApp next okay so if you find any glitch you
can um you can rise up uh query on the WhatsApp group
got it
okay so can anyone please give me your ID uh you what will be the uh final
screen once you complete your signup
process those who done
successfully okay i take G1 ID that was the first one which is
shared okay so once you done successfully I will share
the close all the accounts okay
so if you put the ID is it done successfully or you have given the
Okay so once you done successfully completely creating your your account has been registered successfully if you
paste your link in the same window you will be receiving this login page jven
can you please share your login credentials once if you're comfortable
can you please share the
password so you have to sum you have to use your official email ID
uh need to share
the so if you are getting something went wrong please try refresh the screen and try once again you will be getting the
link
why I was not able to get yours has been used
ination
please people are repeatedly asking the same question over again and again i told you multiple times for company you
have to choose IBM just type IBM so if you type IBM it will show multiple
options so you don't need to pick anything just type IBM and click on next it will work
okay i will take um let's utilize this class for the uh NLP i will connect with
anyone else i will take your credentials i will create a video and I will share it in the WhatsApp group now let's focus
on NLP can anyone tell me what is NLP
hope you'll agree with me like we are shall we continue with NLP and later
on we look on this
issue okay noted very good so many of you has given
the right
answer okay have you spoken to Alexa like uh typed in Google translator or
asked something in charge GP to write
something which means you have been already used this NLP all uh uh already
right okay imagine you're talking to Alexa okay Alexa or a Siri and you're asking Alexa to play your favorite song
so what Alexa will do now so Alexa understands you and finds
your playlist and play the song which you have requested how does Alexa understand what you
said how does Alexa understand what you
[Music] said it's a NLP in action right so NLP
stands for natural language processing it is how computer learns to understand
human
language so why do we need
NLP why do we need
NLP convert our language to machine language very good because machine can speak only binary
right so but we human speaks in words yeah so NLP helps the computer to
understand what do we say or write so response in a way that makes sense so
that is why we need NLP okay now can you can you name a product which
talks to you or responds to your message can you list the products which
talks to you which uh responds to your
message chatbot good jiny okay alexa Siri Amazon chat
assistant very good so all of the you have mentioned many tools right all of
them uses NLP now let's
understand so chatbot machine translators sentiment analysis speech
recognization all these use
NLP okay now first we have to understand how the NLP understand language okay so
to understand human language computer need to learn some rules okay uh let's see what are the those rules okay here
we have six language levels the first level is phenology okay u when we are in
school we used to learn uh from the sounds right sound system um instead of
learning the letters we will be learn from the letters that is phenology right and second one is morphology then once
you are um learn with the sounds then we will learn from the word parts yeah and the
third one is we have syntax right with the help of grammar we know how to place the noun how to place the verb and how
to write a complete sentence in the fourth one we do have the fourth language is semantics which means word
meaning yeah if I write bat it can be a animal it can be a cricket bat right and
then we have uh pragmatics which means meaning in context right and the last
one is discourse so we are just having the flow between the uh sentence this is how we have learned any language right
just like human computer also need to learn these rules okay so how these
rules are steps in NLP let's see the following thing excuse me just a minute
i'm so sorry for the interruption
see when we are discussing about any uh uh core level topic please if you have
any doubts regarding that you can ask it up okay if you have any issue with the prollearn or any other uh credential
issues we can use last 15 minutes for that so that we can understand we can understand the flow of the class okay uh
I understood tala you have not received the pron credentials Uh already I have shared a Google form
please use the form and um fill the query
okay you have dumped the inbox with all your message same message
i'm so sorry i forgot that I'm in mute and I'm keep on talking my sincere
apologies okay let me let me um go through this again okay
so already we have discussed so here we have the basics if you want to understand any language any human
speaking language these are the six steps right the first one is you have to understand phenology so the sound system
uh for example the for the letter K and C we used to say C right so we have to
find the difference between cat and kite right so sound system first we understand the sound system after
understanding the sound system we do have the morphology where we'll be understanding the word structure okay
once you know how to frame the words in structure then we have to follow the rules syntax how to write a sentence
where I have to place the grammar where I sorry where I have to place the noun where I have to place the adverb okay
and then once you are comfortable once you know how to write a sentence the next thing is you have to understand the
semantics yeah sometimes uh for example if you give the word bat yeah so you
should know the meaning of word bat yeah so bat can be a cricket bat or it can be
a uh bird bat right sorry animal bat uh so similarly you have to find the
semantics meaning of the sentence like meaning of the words where you have to use it and next one is pragmatics so in
pragmatics you will be understanding the um uh meaning in context for example can
you pass the salt is it request or order please close the door it is a request or order so you have to understand the
context okay that is pragmatics and the last one is we do have the discosure so
we used to call this discosure as a flow between the sentence okay um for example I have two sentence he
went to the shop and it was closed now I I know what the it means it means the
shop right so this is how we have learned any human speaking language
right now if you want if you if the machine want to understand the human
speaking language it will be using NLP we know that right how NLP works what are the uh ways so what are the
different steps that NLP takes to understand the human speaking languages okay can I move on to that slide are you
clear till then
yes Kabir are you clear with the last slide should I have to explain Good
what was the first category could you please show it once yeah
sure see we have six uh if you're going to learn any new human speaking language
first you have to understand the phology which means sound of each letter then morphology the structure and formation
of the word how to form the words and syntax how to write a sentence using the
grammatics yeah that is the syntax which is the third uh step to learn any new
language and the fourth step is semantics so the understanding the meaning of same word
Right then pragmatics uh where you will be understanding the context how the
meaning of the context uh whether the ask a question the statement is question
or a request or a order yeah and the last one is disclosure which means you are connecting two different words two
different sentence with a meaning which means the flow between the
sentence yeah so these are the six steps that we will be taking to learn any human speaking
language is it
clear yes so shall we continue uh shall we understand the
NLP okay thank you for your responses
now see in NLP the very first task is
tokenization which means uh it will understand the word by breaking it see
we are not going to give word by word right when you're going to talk to Alexa you will be giving a sentence right so
the um NLP will break the word break the sentence into small small words so the
computer can understand one word at a
time so these are the six steps that NLP
takes the first one is tokenization as I said before it will break the sentence into words okay and the second one is
stop words removal which means remove the common useless words which mean for example if the word is if the sentence
contains something like is the and the connecting uh adverbs okay so it will
the computer will remove all that for example let's take a sentence this is a great movie okay so in this sentence the
computer will remove a and s so the the the only left thing is this great movie
why why the computer is removing all this because it give only the it it's
going to take only the important words are used so only it is removing the um
common useless word okay and third step is stemming in stemming it will cut
words to their root for example uh it will remove the uh um uh the past past
tense future tense or a present tense you just take only the word for example if you are giving playing it will take
only pay if you give played it again will take only pay if you give place again it will stemming and it will take
only pay why because all the words it will treat all similar word as one that
is the reason it will removing all the um uh um the verbs from that the tense
from the word okay and the fourth step is
limitation sorry limitization so over here it will do the
uh smart smarter stemming which means what is stemming it will cut the tense from the word right over here it will
check the grammar before converting okay so uh for example if you are giving
running it will take run if you give better it will take
good and the fourth step is post tagging which means it will label each word for
example if you give the word cat chases the mice okay so it will tag cat as a
noun uh chase as a verb and mice as a noun do why the computer has to do like
this what do you
think very good it is categorization to understand the concept
very good good sham to understand the subject action
good see why the computer is doing the uh tagging label for each word because
uh so the computer knows what each word does in the sentence so that is the reason it is tagging up okay and the
sixth step is naming entity recognization which means ne find the names for example if you give one
sentence um maybe um which sentence we can take
it up okay ms Dhoni was born in Karachi so in that sentence ne will deduct MS
Dhoni is a person and Karachi is a location okay so why why it has why ne
has to happen in the
sentence to fetch the sematics meaning very good is the classes boring I can see
many thumbs up thumbs
phone sure I will explain it on one second sure I will explain five and six
once again so I want to take a honest feedback from
each one of you is the classes boring because I I don't understand like I'm just getting a mixture emojis so I'm
just
confused am I going fast
i'm sorry instead of saying Ranji I said Karachi i'm so
sorry sorry I gave a wrong example instead of saying uh Ranji I said Karachi got confused with the terms oh
that is why many uh thumbs down
sure sure i'm explaining once I complete this I will give you a task we going
to Okay thanks for the feedback we'll get into the topic again
okay so here we have five uh steps uh in this five steps um the very first one
is organization which means from the given sentence the sentence will be breakd into words so from the words the
computer can understand one word at a time for this tokenization and the second step is uh stop words removal
which means removing common unused sorry useless words from the given sentence right so for example um if it is
a I'm a great person so from that I'm great person will be taken uh will be
removed because computer only focus on important words okay and the third step is stemming in stemming you just cut
root words to their sorry cut words to their root for example if you're giving play play place or a smart smarter
something like that so it will uh stem the words to smart why it is doing it
just want to treat all similar word as once that is the reason it is just stemming up and the fourth one is
lemonization so in lemonization is again the same smarter stemming is called as
lemonization for example over here if you give running if you give the word in
any tense it can be past or future or present tense it just take as a normal word for example if you give running it
will take only run if you give better it will take good because it will check the
grammar before converting so that is called as lemonization okay and the fifth one is POS tagging
which means it will give label to each word so already in tokenization the
words will be splitted right so once it is splitted they were going to give some labels uh is it a noun verb or adverb so
that the computer can understand the importance of each word in the sentence what it is does in the sentence okay and
the last step is ne named entity recognization so what it will be doing it will be find the names find the
sentence I mean um uh for example if I give
um Alan mask lives in Texas so what is the first step
happens tokenization so in tokenization it will split the sentence Alan mask
lives in sentence so it will break into one one words after then it will remove
all the useless words so in this given context we don't have any use other
meaningful and we'll go for the third one which is tagging and there is no stemming is also not required so it it
will go to the next which is tagging so in that tagging it will get Elan Mask is a person and Texas is a
location so now the machine knows Elan Mask is a person and Texos is a me place
okay so hope you all are clear with
this now shall we do a task with
NLP okay
all
right now uh even now the machine knows only um numbers right uh even in this
NLP in in the six steps we are just dividing the characters now how these
text will be converting to numbers so uh the conversion may happen between bags
to word there are two techniques okay uh uh sorry there are many techniques uh
the first technique is back to words what what is back to words
so all the character has to been converted to zero and one which is called as back to word
okay and we do have word embedding we do have context embedding
we'll see all that once when we get deeper into the
concept okay now shall we use Python uh let's use Python to do that
okay
so can you all open your comfortable IDE
the choice is yours you can use notebook you can use um collab
so so to if you want to use NLP in Python then we need to install a few
packages like uh NLTK which means natural language toolkit scikit learning
transformers torch so these are our toolkits we're going to use all this in our code now
okay just a second let me share my screen
okay uh so over here I will open a new I
just stop shared the screen and I will share you my uh notebook
prolog I'm so sorry by mistake I just open my Jupyter
notebook okay so over here what I'm going to do I'm just going to install
the toolkit
Did you all open your IDE
i'm just going to my terminal and I'm just pasting all this and I'm
clicking okay so uh NLTK which is uh natural language toolkit and we need uh
scikit learn and we need transformer and we need touch
Now we have to download the required resources so NLTK it's also need some
language data right so we are going to download uh things like uh tokenizer uh
stop word list and POS tagger
okay did you all completed this
can I move on to the
next name of the first category so far we have just distinguished about like
linguistic basics and basics of NLP
see that is exclamatory mark is like we are just with the help of pip we are installing all the required libraries to
our python
you're just going to practice NLP
we just going to understand how NLP works that is that's why we are having this code so through this code you're
going to understand how a bag of how post tagging is happening how limitization is happening how stemming
is happening
purely just only for the
understanding we know that that NLT is a natural language to which is only used for the education purpose
maybe I can show you in the PPD itself where I have added all the code
oh I'm sorry so here we are just installing the required libraries because we just going to practice NLP in
Python if you want to practice NLP in Python then we have to use the NLP toolkit we need silent scikit learning
and transformers and touch as well so why we are using pip over here because these are the libraries Python library
and if you want to install these library into your Python into your IDE that has
to be done with the help of pip
only so here we have we are just going to use punk which is used for tokenization so with help of first you
have to import the uh NLTK this toolkit okay with the help of
import keyword so once you import this keyword it will uh uh all the functionalities uh classes uh belongs to
this package has been installed to your local environment okay so through this
package you're going to download this uh tokenization resource method
[Music]
so we are just importing all the tools that we are going to uh use in our code
okay and we do we have to download word net which is for lemonization these are different fun uh different method which
is available inside the uh
NLTK and post [Music] tagging and this is for
[Music] ne so once you install once you import
this all this resource to your code and the next step is uh we have to practice
each um phase of NLP one after the other so before getting into this we have to
understand what is this NLTK which is a this toolkit is only developed for the education and research purpose in NLP
and over here we have some pre-built algorithms data sets and this is only helpful for
tokenization text classification um tagging lemonization parsing semantic
uh reasoning
See this module this module is for des um
splitting the text into words that is node uh uh tok to tokenize is for
splitting the words from the given sentence okay and the second one second one is corpus so this is for when you
are going to access a large collection of text so we will be using this module
okay and next one is stem so the stem is nothing but stemming so over here we are just reducing the words to their root
form okay and the next is tagging so here we just tag the parts of speech of
the words okay and we do have chunk in chunk we will be performing uh
nees I'm sorry ne okay then parse so in parse we are just using the sematic
syntax parsing text using grammar rule okay and classify this is a tool for
text classification and over in metrics once everything is done we're just going to evaluate through the NLP model
[Music]
okay so any doubts till
then sure i will show the commands on second
they all ask the same question let me let me show you once
again you want this slide or the import slide
if you're talking about
[Music] import so these are the required libraries once you install all the
required libraries we will be downloading the all the required modules from the NLT package
[Music]
should I move on to the next slide
yes I I will show the previous
slide so these are the libraries maybe if you all want I can uh copy paste the
libraries in chat
once that you can use it up i have shared all the libraries in chat
after the debase we are just going to use NLTK which is natural language toolkit
so over [Music] here we are downloading all the
resource if you all want I even I can
Maybe I dropped those in chat maybe you can use it up
next we have seen the uh introduction okay and we have seen the
major components of NLTK so here we have the common
functionalities over again so for semantics we have to use the module tokenize so for removing the stop words
we have to use corpus dots stopwords and for stemming we have to use nltk stem uh
porter stemer okay so these are the common functionalities and these are the corresponding modules for
that okay so once you download all this and now you have to import it
so so here I have the common uh simple
code okay we'll see this code tomorrow i stop over here so in today's class we have just
understand uh we have just tried to create the IBM skill network um account so for a few it is done
successfully for few it is not turn up successfully so those who are not for those who are not turned it up
successfully please try it once when try to sign up the IBM skill account okay
so if possible I try to get any one of your credentials and try to uh create
the steps
okay and I will share the v uh video in uh prollearn as well as in
um WhatsApp
group no worries it's fine okay now it's time it's the query time
so if you have any doubts if you have any queries related to the today's session please drop your queries i'm I
will answer one after the other and if you don't have any doubt any queries you can leave the session thank you so much
for joining and if you have any concerns about the session how it can be uh uh
like how it can be make a very interactive if you want to add anything
to the session please drop uh uh I always welcome your uh suggestions and feedback you can drop it in the chat as
well okay Pranita uh regarding the prologue prolon is under maintenance
either by today or tomorrow you can able to access prolon okay dear
yes Nagarbal you're supposed to type this in your if you're using VS code then of
course you have to use in your terminal by dear
[Music] byas sure Michael so what is subming and uh uh ner again okay I just share the
Three
maybe I can do like this
okay so over here let's let's take an example okay
um so let's take one sentence m give me a sentence
okay so this is a sentence okay so in this the first step is are you able to see my screen
is okay so here I have the uh example Sachinar played cricket in India okay so
over here first we just going to do um token so what is token splitting the
text into multiple words small small word is called as tokenize okay so now what NLP
will do it will [Music]
break so it will do uh
suchin okay so in tokonization it will split all the words into sorry uh it
split the words from the sentence okay one one word okay after then the second one is stop word removal so over there
it will remove all the unused words so from this sentence it will remove n
because n is not used not useless in the sentence which is uh stop word removal
okay and third one is stemming so cutting the words to their root which is called a stemming okay over here it is
mentioned as played so it will be cuted as play so why we are doing the stemming to
treat all the words all similar word as once so that is the reason we are doing stemming okay uh stemming and the next
one is lemonization so in lemonization is smarter way of stemming you are clear with that and you want me to explain
named entity recognization so over here what we will be doing we are just giving the
um uh name place like finding names like uh giving the noun to this okay so over
here Sachin tendur is a person right india is a location yeah so why we are
doing that because we are extracting the real world information from the given text so we will be giving the place uh
people name dates etc that is called as ne is
it
clear Michael sorry m
Okay Michelle thank you ma'am after logging into the IBM it is showing button catalog what to
do um I'm not clear with you're in which screen you're asking after registering
the IBM skill build sure shoubam so the last step is like ne
which means from the given context it will add the noun name place uh date to
understand the uh context of the
sentence okay hope all your doubts has been sorted
okay if it is showing like that please keep it uh as it is we'll discuss [Music]
tomorrow okay if you're not able to complete sh uh shani please try after
some time okay thank you so thank you all hope all
your doubts has been
sorted and I can understand uh Shvani Shani I'm sorry
um so please try after some time maybe the site might be busy the server might
be busy so you can try after some
Okay come reminiscation means like it is the smart
Smartest naming is called as lemonization which means removing all the tense from your uh sentence for or
the word see if you're done logging into the skill bill well and good nagi will do
tomorrow the upcoming steps now the class has been completed
i'm just sorting the uh queries whatever queries coming on the chat I'm just sorting it up all right hope all the
queries has been sorted no queries for the
day is all your queries has been answered can I end up the session can you all please respond
yes thank you all meet you tomorrow bye-bye take care
