to create anything over here we use um any of the uh Python ID where we can
create the code
yeah this is different that one is IBM skill network where you have to register and fetch the I feature code and this is
the IBM cloud account this is a main page where we are going to work this IBM cloud is a paid version okay so not not
everyone can access to this so you are the students you're uh you paid for it
right so you you're just navigating to a skill network from the skill network you will be getting your unique feature code
with the help of the unique feature code you're creating your account in IBM cloud
okay all right so over here what we have to
do here you have to choose what's next AI so this is the environment where we
going to create the projects so you have to click on the launch button

sha I told you don't dump with the same text on the
inbox i'm sharing my
screen hope my screen is vis visible to everyone so from here we have to create
the first project very first project so I just go to the uh again in the Watson
x environment I have just click on the uh hamburger icon from there select the
projects from the projects you do have the option view all projects okay you
have to click on view all projects go to the hamburger icon from there select
projects from there select the option view all projects okay after selecting
that you will be getting this menu from there just select the option new
project okay so here you have to give the project name um I'm just giving the
project name as demo always we have to give a meaningful name to the project and this description is optional if you
want to describe about the particular project you can add two or three lines of descriptions and here we do have the
tags so this tag is all about again it is optional this tag is all about when you're creating the project so there we
will be adding some um tags like um uh maybe you can give the tags of severity
maybe uh high priority low priority or in progress closed you can give such
kind of uh tags so that you can easily understand what what is the status of the particular project okay and below to
that you have something called storage so where your projects are getting stored it is for me it is getting stored
in the cloud object storage for everyone the option will be the same cloud op um cloud object storage okay after then we
have to click on create are you all on the same page those who have the uh ID are you on
the same page the account type should be company
am I going fast
i'm going but many are like um drafting in the inbox that I'm going I'm speaking
very
fast for you it's very slow now
Adita better I just take a poll to understand it
so do everyone create the very first project
uh so this is just for the understanding like because I'm just getting mixer of inputs in the chat some are saying I'm
just too fast some are saying I'm very
slow so over here we have 555 so which is
554 i want each one of you to answer this
um so uh I got the 60%age of the audience like I'm in the right pace so I
think I can proceed with that
okay so once we got this page here once you fill all the um inputs you have to
click on create
so it will take few seconds okay so here if you notice we have four options the
very first option is you can add any any number of user to the current project
for example if you're creating a chatbot and if you want your friends to contribute in the particular project
then you can add that particular person as a contributor over here okay and the next one is working with data so we know
that if you are if you're going to create any application then we need a data set so you can add your data set
over here okay and if you uh in in uh the in
uh genai we will be working on the pre-built models yeah we will be choosing any one of the foundation model
in on that with that foundation model we will be building over it so if you want to choose any um foundation model from
the IBM um you can click on it from here you can choose it up so it will list uh
it will show list of um services and from there you can
choose it up so you all done till this
Yeah sure I will show the one step back so what you have to do just go one step back so over here
you have to fill all the details the project name and the description yeah
and once you filled everything then you have to click on create the create button will be
enabled and once it is enabled then you can click on it and where you can start
working on the project so this was the one which is created
right then you will be landing on this
page so with this let's take a short break short 10 minutes break uh we'll
we'll meet exactly by 610 and we'll start creating our first uh NLP in this
what's next
okay so let's take a short break
yes let me show you once again so others can go for a short 10 minutes break and
those who have missed how to create a what's next project I will show you once again okay exactly from uh 6 we will
start creating the first project so I just go back over here uh I just stop
shared the screen and I just close the particular
window stop sharing the screen

project from there
just now I just explained the steps of creating the
project
okay okay
now over here we just going to create the very first sample project okay
last class we have discussed about NLP
Hey okay so here I can create only gen AI projects right which means I have to
choose any one foundation model over the foundation model I have to uh uh build
the application right so last class I have shown you how to create a NLP through Python now let's complete that
and then we understand what are the foundation model which is available on the WhatsApp next then we'll create our
first uh uh geni application in this so uh we'll do that tomorrow so meanwhile
others Please do complete your process tomorrow let's all together create the
first application in the what's next i hope you all agree with
me if you have a third opinion please drop that in chat
yes so I let me share
the so last we are just started to create the um uh install all the required uh
applications right I mean uh the um packages
So is my PPT is visible to you all
just a second i'm sharing the screen oh my
god class is not over
first let's understand the NLP simple application creation um few of her
having issue with [Music] um IB what's the next
right people you you all started to dump the same
query okay so last class we have seen what is
NLP what is the basic uh things if you want to learn a language and how NLP
works so we just going to see the example project for each topic
okay so did you all complete uh installing all the required libraries in
your Python uh IDE
one second my Python is getting
loaded okay first let me show you how tokenization is working okay
so okay having some issue with
my Jupyter notebook so I'm just opening collab
okay uh let me share the screen uh before then I just close
this hide okay so if you if you want to use
this NLP in our project then we required all this library to be installed okay so
uh in last class itself I have installed this NLTK I have installed the sky Kurtlin I have installed all the
transformers and we have just imported all the required resources right so we
have imported the uh all the resources now let me show you
how to do how tokenization is happening in Python so I'm just stop sharing the
screen just go back and I'm sharing this collab
up okay
so first what I have to do I have import my
uh NLTK right so first let's do import NLTK so what is
NLTK can anyone let me know what is NLTK
it's a natural language toolkit all right so after
then some issue
Okay so next uh so from this library
NLTK I'm going to use the one particular module
called tokenize
okay and from that I'm just going to import the
word then we have to import the resource right so which resource we have to download so from NLP TK I'm going to use
the function download okay
typo so there U N KT
so this is help us
to tokenize the given text so let's give uh let's create a variable called text
in this variable I'm just going
to you can give any text maybe I can
give or what can we give maybe randomly some
text okay i just title in the
series okay so this is my input now it has to be split as a token so I need a
variable in that variable only the given sentence will be broken as a small small
token so let's create a variable called
token okay so in this variable uh I'm just going to use the um method word tok
this this one word tokenize so I'm just copying this and putting it over here and I have to pass the uh variable in
which variable I do have all the sentence so this is a variable in this variable only I have the sentence titled
in the series so I just paste the variable then if I print the
[Music] variable now let's see the output
I guess I'm do anyone got the
output this is not Jupiter my Jupiter is taking so much time to load so I have used just collab
okay this is done properly maybe this might be some keyword
oh so we have error on
this okay uh yeah remember last class I have just imported all the libraries in
um Jupyter notebook so over here first of all I need to install all the required libraries
okay here I have all
this so others those who installed this on yesterday do you got the output
uh let me fix the error just a
second okay
unfortunately my screen I missed where I made a mistake
okay sometimes when uh like it is the the um PNK which is downloaded in the
default location right so we have to add the the where the path has been located
so we have to give the uh location so maybe over
here after downloading I have to give the
path let's check whether it is working fine or not
still it is in different directory i guess something wrong when I tried
with notebook uh it was working fine the same code I run in my notebook then only
I just taken the
N can you please share me your code if it is working very
well and I have applied the same
uh Okay it summons code in
chat okay so you have installed the tab as well so that was a uh error which I
uh got lastly so I just missed the resource uh uh blanket tab so you have
just added it and then you got the output right good good so this was the uh function which I
missed so over here we have given title in the series so everything has been um
tokenized and it has been stored in a
list yes see if you give the same code in uh VS code it will automatically
fetch the uh from the downloads it will fetch the path and you can get the output so that is why I added this code
in um uh PPT as well but in collab it is not
working in collab we have to set the
path and VS code is working very fine i just tried VS code then only I have
taken the uh put it in the PPT
[Music] all right so the next one which we have
to what is the next uh after tokenization what we have to do can do anyone remember after tokenization what
we have to do
after tokenization what we have to do
I didn't see any
response
after tokenization what we have to
do it is uh limitization or stemming
what is the second phase or second step which is stop word removal very good so
we are just going to remove the unwanted uh words from the given context right
very good most of you have given the right answer see how to do
that so which libraries we have we are going to use for
that so uh
uh so from NLTK natural language toolkit we
just going to use the corpus corpus we're just going to import
stop word stop
thoughts then I'm just going to use the NL
TK see previously when I type the code it is not showing because it was not imported because for in the previous
code we have just given import NLTK now it has been imported so it is showing all the um for easy access in dropdown
it is showing the keywords so we're just going to download
the stop words right
so after then I'm going to create a variable so
in that
variable just made a small mistake i'm just going to use the
set where I'm just going to use top words
dot word for the
connection and I have to mention the language in which language the context is in
so English
so let me use the filters filter token so in that we just
checking words of word in the token uh we just converting all into lower case after converting it into lower case we
are just checking it up okay
you all get the code
so if we run the Four
we have properly imported it and we have downloaded this
okay okay so it is saying where we have not mentioned tokens okay let's do one
thing in token okay i just copy
this and let me put it here as a new
variable cons equals just paste what I have copied now if I run it will
works yeah so here I just missed to give the tokens okay so here if you notice so
from the given tokens it will remove the useless word which is in and the and we
are getting the important keywords which are title and series so how it is working so first we have the corpus
um uh we have import the module stop module from the NLTK corpus okay this
top words which is which is help us to this module help us to remove the um uh
text uh like usually mentioning data maybe we can see the commonly useless words in the given sentence okay and
then we have download the stop words so this stoper data set from the NLTK library so from the library we have
download the stop words data set okay so once it is done and we have to give the
tokens then we have mentioned what are the tokens that we have and then u in the next sentence we have created a
variable called step words in that step words we have set the step words
dot words so what is the purpose of using set so it is help us uh to look it
very faster so we can say the faster lookup so it is checking whether the given item in the
list so it will load only the English language context okay and then we are
just filtering the uh tokens so it is go through words each word in the token so
word for word in token just got each word in the token from the given list
and we are just compare like if if suppose if we have any uh upper case lowerase combination I'm just converting
everything to the lower case okay so after uh changing everything to a lower
case it will be easy for us to um remove the uh useless words so only
words not in the stop words all will be uh filtered in the uh filter token And
it is displayed in the
output clear do anyone have doubt in this
We move on to the next
I can't see this
shall we create what is the third step so first we have uh tokenize the
given sentence after tokenizing the given sentence we have just removed the stop words after removing the stoppers
what is the third step which we have to follow now
what is the third step which we have to
do now we have to do the porter stemer right very good stemming
tagging is after then only after simming only we will be having limitation let's do
it so over here what we have to do next I'm just creating another set of Good
so from
NLTK dot stem
import portter simmer so first we are just importing
the uh proto simmer class from the nltk the module name is stem
okay this photo symbol is one of the common most used stemming algorithm so
with with this we can able to reduce the uh word from their stem okay and after
then I'm just going to create a um a variable in that variable I'm just going
to call a class
let me create a variable
called stemer okay in this variable I'm going
to call the class water stemmer so I have to mention
this okay and over here I'm just going to give the
words equal to so what can we give
um playing right I have taken the same
example which I explained the concept if you want you can take some other examples as
well okay now I'm just going to create one more variable called stems in
this I'm going to check word by word so I'm just going to create a list
in that list in a loop mode I'm just going to check each word in the given list
okay so in this
list first let me call this simmer
dot stem so which one I have to check i have
to check the variable words right so I'm just mentioning
words uh-oh not words
for bird in the variable
words wrongly
closed then I'm just going to print the
output st even though I give different uh
context it it I just uh remove
the remove the word to their root [Music]
so here we have three uh variants playing played play so it's all reduced to the common stem play so now what is
the next thing
after this what we have to
do we have lemonization right so it will reduce to the word in a dictionary form
okay so before going to the lemonization do everyone got the output for this lemonization
yes
great so if you want to do for the previous sentence then what you have to do instead of this words okay over you
have to use the same context if for example here I have given the tokens right so you have to copy and paste the
tokens if you're going to use all in one all code in one then you can have a
common uh variable with that variable you can you can call in all the
process since I'm showing things separately it was like
this is connected
11 okay now let's do
uh reminiscation so I'm just creating a new code so in that new code I'm just
going to from the
NLTK it's going to be the
same i'm just copying
so so instead of the port stemmer here we just going to use word lemonizer okay
this class help used for lemonization in words
so word
knit okay then we have to download the required data set so
NLTK dot download and the data set name
is word
sorry birdnet
then I'm just going to open um multi- uh lingual word net so this will supports
for the extended language if you're going to use any other language for that language you it will be using okay this
this data
set usual we just going to create the variable in that variable we are going
to call the
class over here we're just going to add the post tagging as well so here I'm
just printing the word if I'm going to print the word better so I'm just giving
a tag to it remember I'm just giving the tag as adjective if I give a a means
adjective okay if I give V V means um verb
so in limonization itself we are just adding the
tag so once you're done if you let's check the
output so for better we got good and for running we got run and we have added uh
tags as
well do you want these codes in prolong
kartikaria okay so POS means I'm just adding a tag i'm just mentioning this
word is a adjective what is the um uh we are just giving remember uh we do have
the five steps six steps right so in the six steps we will be adding the tags to understand the purpose of the word in
the given sentence so this PO is called as part of speech so PO is tagging
so which is optional i'm just optionally adding it here okay maybe I just give the next
sentence i'm sorry next is uh fifth step is uh uh POS part of speech tagging so
due to time constraint I'm just copy paste the particular code from my reference PPT slide
how I will upload the PPT right so over there uh you will be having all the uh
code in the PPT you will be you can see all the code
okay here I have taken the sentence uh dog barks loudly
so in word I'm just tokenization and I'm just adding the POS tag now let's see
what is the output
okay it has some mirror let's check
I missed the data set I
[Music] guess so which is not
found so let's let's take this suggestion
so pre previous data set was not available with this editor so I just change the data set name and now you can
see
that so it is showing that uh NNS means non uh non plural noun okay so for that
we are just giving NNS and
um over here for B which it is giving VBP so which
means it is a verb and it is in present
tense and we have the loudly which is mentioned as RB which means adverb
okay so what is the last uh uh last um step in
this which is named entity recognization right so it's very
simple so what is that we are just giving the entities like the importance
of the word in a particular sentence
[Music]
So to do that we do have different library from that I have taken a spacy library and so from NLP I'm just loading
the excuse me so first I have imported the spacy uh library which is a fast and
efficient library that is why I have chosen that and after then I created a variable called NLP in that variable I'm
just loading the small English model which is called as encore web SM so this
this this model includes all tokenizer post tagger
any okay
uh maybe let's check the output
If you notice um this was the example like the this was the same code which I
added in the PPT as well so if you notice Barack Obama is a person and Hava
is a
GP okay gp means it's a country city
state okay so with this we have practiced all these six steps that we have learned in NLP okay so in
tomorrow's class we just going to create our first modu uh foundation model in what's next so in tomorrow's class we're
going to understand what is foundation model how to choose a model for a given problem and with that let's start
creating our first problem
okay okay you want me the same code in chat okay i will share the code in
chat so if you have any doubt in today's session please drop your doubts in
chat no assignment okay can I give you one task
maybe you can try and this is not the and this is not for the evaluation just
only for the practice
[Music]
